<p>At Peicai Secondary School, we believe that every student has the potential to be developed into a leader. The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) of the school develops student leadership in a progressive manner through Values-In-Action (VIA) projects.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Secondary One</strong></h4>
<p>At the Secondary One level, Peicaians get the opportunity to organise the annual Peicai Fair in which they have to plan and set up food and drinks stalls as well as self-invented games stalls in the school. The funds raised will then be donated to a selected beneficiary.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Secondary Two</strong></h4>
<p>At the Secondary Two level, Peicaians are given autonomy to decide and plan their VIA projects. As a class, they choose and decide on the community which they would like to focus on and they also get to choose the organisations that they would like their projects to impact on.</p>

<h4><strong>Secondary Three</strong></h4>
<p>For the Secondary Three students, they are also involved in the Pass-It-On project in which they have to be advocates for the cause that they have selected. Upon completion of their VIA projects, they will visit primary schools and create awareness of their selected cause in the primary school students.</p>

<p>After the completion of the LLP journey, every Peicaian is envisioned to become persons for others.&nbsp;</p>
