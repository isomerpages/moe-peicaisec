<h4><strong>Sexuality Education</strong></h4>
<p><strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong> 
<br>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education
(SEd) in schools aims to enable students to understand the physiological,
social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy
and rewarding relationships with others, including those with members of
the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the
basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages
and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching
and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the
different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of
Sexuality Education are to:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support students in managing
their physiological, social and emotional changes as they grow up and develop
safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guide students to make wise,
informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help students develop a moral
compass and respect for themselves and others by having positive mainstream
values and attitudes about sexuality that are premised on the family as
the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love and respect yourself
as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build positive relationships
based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make responsible decisions
for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstinence before marriage
is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual
sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.

</p>
<p><strong>Sexuality Education Lessons:</strong>
</p>
<p>6. The values and attitudes of our youth towards sexuality are increasingly
shaped by their peers, exposure to the media, popular culture and the internet.
Adolescence is a complex stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find
his/her own identity and often struggles with new social relationships.
The period of middle adolescence (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can
be a turbulent period for adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive
maturity may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various
activities (including sexual activities), sometimes without understanding
the unpleasant consequences that may arise from such experimentation. The
need for peer acceptance can be overwhelmingly strong and hinder one’s
ability to act responsibly.&nbsp; Given the pressures faced by the middle
adolescent from within themselves and from peers, it is important to build
a strong sense of self-worth, personal conviction and an understanding
of the possible consequences of sexual behaviour.
<br>
<br>7. Through the Sexuality Education lessons, secondary students will have
the opportunity to develop a positive self-esteem, develop their character,
and expand their understanding and repertoire of skills to deal with various
issues related to sexuality, which are of prime concern at this age.
<br>
<br><strong>At PEICAI Secondary School, the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in <u>2024</u>:</strong>

<p><strong>eTeens Programme:</strong>
</p>
<p>8. <em>eTeens</em> is a programme developed by Health Promotion Board, in
collaboration with the Ministry of Education, to provide Secondary 3 students
with accurate information on STIs, HIV and protection from a health perspective. <em>eTeens</em> is
conducted in two segments – a mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme.
The desired outcome of the <em>eTeens</em> programme is that students are
empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions.
<br>
<br>9. Students are taught skills such as decision-making, assertiveness and
negotiation to say “no” to sex and negative peer pressure. They also learn
that the impact of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and involves their
family, and the importance of responsible decision-making and seeking help.
Abstinence and upholding family values are the key messages.
<br>
<br><strong>At PEICAI Secondary School, the <em>eTeens</em> programme will be implemented as follows in 2024:</strong>
