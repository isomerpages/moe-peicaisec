<h4><strong>PHILOSOPHY AND APPROACH</strong></h4>
<p>The code of conduct serves to nurture in our students desired values and behaviours that are exemplary.</p>
<p>The discipline processes and systems in the school are designed to help and guide students to think responsibly, reflect on their actions, understand the consequences of actions as well as responsibilities and come up with collaborative solutions to move forward. Discipline offences will have a direct impact on conduct grade, testimonial of students</p>
<p>The school has a clear set of rules and regulations, which together with the school&rsquo;s philosophy for discipline, are shared with the students. The rationale for each segment of the rules and regulations have been articulated explicitly to ensure that students do not follow rules blindly. Instead, students should understand the intentions and reasons for these rules as well as how these rules would serve them well in future as they progress to the next phase of their education and lives.</p>
<p>We trust that students who graduate from PCSS would leave the school as responsible young adults and citizens who are ready to contribute to the community and the nation.</p>
<h4><strong>ATTIRE</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Rationale: To present oneself well and uphold the good name of the school with pride both in and out of school</strong></p>

<li>The length of the school skirt should not be 3cm higher than the knees.</li>
<li>The school pants/shorts/shirt/skirt is of the correct size and not oversized, too tight or too short.</li>
<li>White/black or dark coloured school based t-shirts can be worn underneath the school shirt. No bright or fluorescent coloured t-shirts e.g. bright pink, neon green or orange etc.</li>
