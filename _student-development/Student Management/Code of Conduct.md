<h4><strong>Philosophy and Approach</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The code of conduct serves to nurture in our students desired values and
behaviours that are exemplary.</p>
<p>The discipline processes and systems in the school are designed to help
and guide students to think responsibly, reflect on their actions, understand
the consequences of actions as well as responsibilities and come up with
collaborative solutions to move forward. Discipline offences will have
a direct impact on conduct grade, testimonial of students</p>
<p>The school has a clear set of rules and regulations, which together with
the school’s philosophy for discipline, are shared with the students. The
rationale for each segment of the rules and regulations have been articulated
explicitly to ensure that students do not follow rules blindly. Instead,
students should understand the intentions and reasons for these rules as
well as how these rules would serve them well in future as they progress
to the next phase of their education and lives.</p>
<p>We trust that students who graduate from PCSS would leave the school as
responsible young adults and citizens who are ready to contribute to the
community and the nation.</p>
<h4><strong>ATTIRE</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Rationale: To present oneself well and uphold the good name of the school with pride both in and out of school</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform. Modification to
the uniform is strictly not allowed.</p>
<p>2. All students are to ensure that they are properly attired at all times
including during the school holidays and outside of school.</p>
<p>3. No external attire is allowed in school at all times.</p>
<p>4. All students are to ensure the following with regard to the school
uniform:</p>
<p>(a) Shirts and blouses must be properly buttoned up, worn neatly and smartly
at all times.</p>
<p>(b) The length of the school skirt should not be 3cm higher than the knees.</p>
<p>(c) The school pants/shorts/shirt/skirt is of the correct size and not
oversized, too tight or too short.</p>
<p>(d) White/black or dark coloured school-based t-shirts can be worn underneath
the school shirt. No bright or fluorescent-coloured t-shirts e.g., bright
pink, neon green or orange etc.</p>
<p>(e) Only canvas, sneakers or sports shoes with laces or straps are allowed.
Though students are encouraged to use shoes that are predominately black,
blue or grey - canvas, sneakers and sports shoes of choice can be of any
colour (though students are highly encouraged to avoid bright, flashy and
outlandish designs as well as colours) so long the shoes are suitable for
Physical Education lessons. Slip-on and high-cut shoes are not allowed.
Shoes with lights, wheels or wedges are also not allowed.</p>
<p>(f) Socks should be worn at all times when in school attire. Though students
are encouraged to use socks that are predominately black, white or grey
in colour - the choice of socks can be of any solid colour. Socks with
images, designs, words or large logos are not allowed. Socks should also
be long enough to cover the ankles but not the calf. students are to avoid
bright colours, flashy and outlandish designs.</p>
<p>(g) Any footwear, other than the above prescribed shoes, are not allowed
to be worn in school except for medical reasons and approved by a teacher
with supporting documentation issued by medical practitioners registered
under the Medical Registration Act.</p>

<p>(a) Be punctual and present for the flag raising ceremony, assembly, all
lessons, activities and other school events.</p>
<p>(b) Assemble in the parade square/school hall/classroom by 7:40 am (8:20

assembly area due to valid reasons.</p>
<p>(c) Inform the Form Teachers or the General Office of their absence from
school by 7:40 am (8:20 am on Wednesday) on the day of absence.</p>

absent from school to the Form Teacher on the day of return to school.</p>
<p>(e) Letters from parents/guardians explaining a student’s absence from
school should not exceed 5 in a semester as students’ attendance in school
is critical for them to do well in school. Students will be considered
as absent without valid reason if they have submitted parent letters/emails
for more than 5 days of absence per semester or travelled overseas during
term time for family holidays. Absence without valid reason can be considered
as truancy and appropriate consequences will be meted out.</p>
<p>(f) Letters from parents/guardians cannot be used to explain absence from
tests or examinations. Absence from a test/examination without a valid
MC will result in the student getting a zero mark for the test/examination.</p>
<p>(g) Submitted MCs must be issued by a medical practitioner registered
under the Medical Registration Act or the Dental Registration Act.</p>
<p>(h) Persistent truancy is viewed as a wilful absence from school and may
result in expulsion. A student who is absent from school without any valid
reasons for three days (the days need not be consecutive), will be issued
a letter of warning.</p>
<p>6. A student who has been late without valid reason for six times for
the year will be issued an advisory letter. Persistent late-coming may
result in suspension from school.</p>
<p>7. Upon receiving any letter for late-coming, a student who continues
to be late without any valid reasons or comes to school after 8:00 am and
8:30 am (on late days), may not be allowed to go to class as it would be
highly disruptive to lessons that are on-going.</p>
<p>8. A student who is late on Wednesday (late day) for three times (the
days need not be consecutive) will be placed under the Early Bird Programme.
Students identified for the Early Bird Programme will have to report to
school by 7:40 am. thereafter. Wilful absence from the programme will be
deemed as defiance/truancy, and the affected students will be placed under
detention and/or suspension from school.</p>
<p>9. Students who reach school after 8:00 am would be considered as severely
late. They are to proceed to the General Office to see one of the Vice
Principals (or Student Management KPs if the Vice Principals are not in
schools) to obtain approval to proceed for lessons. Students should not
proceed for lessons or activities for the day unless approval has been
given via the issuance of a late coming slip by a Vice Principal or by
a Student Management KP.</p>
<p>10. Students with late-coming records the previous year, who arrive after
8:00 am and have no valid reasons for being late, will not be allowed to
go to class.</p>
<p>11. Students who have been issued the late-coming slip are required to
submit these slips to their Form Teachers or Subject Teachers for records
purposes.</p>
<p>12. Students with less than 95% attendance (where absence is without valid
medical reasons) may not be allowed to sit for the End-of-Year examinations.</p>
<p>13. Poor attendance in school and persistent late-coming may affect the
conduct grade and testimonial of the student.</p>
<p>14. Curriculum time is of utmost importance, as such, early release from
school or absence during curriculum time will not be approved unless it
is on compassionate grounds. Students are advised to schedule their medical
or dental appointment after curriculum time.</p>
<p>15. Students who need to be absent from school for an extended period
(continuously three or more days) during term time for valid reasons should
seek approval from the Principal/Vice-Principal by filling in a Permission
for Curriculum Absence (PCA) form. Failing which, absence from school during
this period may be considered as truancy.</p>
<p>(a) For planned absences (with valid reasons) from curriculum, application
should be submitted at least 2 weeks before. The PCA form may be obtained
from the school’s General Office.</p>
<p>(b) For last minute request on compassionate grounds, students should
approach the General Office directly if in school or notify via their form
teachers if not in school.</p>
<p>(c) Students on Hospitalisation and/or Medical Leave need not submit the
Permission for Curriculum Absence (PCA) Form and should instead follow
the points listed out in part 5 (c), 5 (d) and 5 (g).</p>
<p>16. Preparing and studying for tests or examinations is not a valid reason
for absence from school and such offences will have a direct impact on
the student’s conduct grade and testimonials.</p>
<p>17. Going on holidays during term time will not be considered as a valid
reason for absence from school, including lessons, CCA and school programmes.
Such offences will have a direct impact on the student’s conduct grade
and testimonials.</p>
<p>18. Attending tuition and other enrichment outside of school will not
be considered as a valid reason for absence from school, afternoon lessons
or programmes and CCA. Such offences will have a direct impact on the student’s
conduct grade and testimonials.</p>
<p>19. Attendance at detention and CWO is compulsory where assigned. Any
assigned hours must be duly completed within the stipulated time. Wilful
absence will be deemed as defiance/truancy, and the affected students will
be placed under extended detention and/or suspension from school.</p>
<p>20. Attendance at CCA is compulsory. Students who are absent from CCA
will need to produce a valid MC (refer to Point 5g above) for the period
of absence to the CCA teacher in-charge. Poor CCA attendance may affect
conduct grade and school/national representation in competitions.</p>
<p>21. If a student no longer has any more lessons for the day, the earliest
time that he/she can be dismissed from school will be at 12:40 pm.</p>
<p>22. Students who do not have any lessons in between periods should do
their own self-revision at the school library. Where there are such instances,
it will be formally arranged by the school. Students are to sign in and
out with the librarian at the library.</p>
