<h4>PHILOSOPHY AND APPROACH</h4>
<h4></h4>
<p>The code of conduct serves to nurture in our students desired values and
behaviours that are exemplary.</p>
<p>The discipline processes and systems in the school are designed to help
and guide students to think responsibly, reflect on their actions, understand
the consequences of actions as well as responsibilities and come up with
collaborative solutions to move forward. Discipline offences will have
a direct impact on conduct grade and testimonial of students.</p>
<p>The school has a clear set of rules and regulations, which together with
the school’s philosophy for discipline, are shared with the students. The
rationale for each segment of the rules and regulations have been articulated
explicitly to ensure that students do not follow rules blindly. Instead,
students should understand the intentions and reasons for these rules as
well as how these rules would serve them well in future as they progress
to the next phase of their education and lives.</p>
<p>We trust that the school’s Code of Conduct will enable students who graduate
from PCSS would leave the school as responsible young adults and citizens
who are ready to contribute to the community and the nation.</p>
<h4>ATTIRE</h4>
<p><strong>Rationale: To present oneself well and uphold the good name of the school with pride both in and out of school</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform. Modification to
the uniform is strictly not allowed.</p>
<p>2. All students are to ensure that they are properly attired at all times
including during the school holidays and outside of school.</p>
<p>3. No external attire is allowed in school at all times.</p>
<p>4. All students are to ensure the following with regard to the school
uniform:</p>
<p>(a) Shirts and blouses must be properly buttoned up, worn neatly and smartly
at all times.</p>
<p>(b) The length of the school skirt should not be 3 cm higher than the
knees.</p>
<p>(c) The school pants/shorts/shirt/skirt is of the correct size and not
oversized, too tight or too short.</p>
<p>(d) White/black or dark coloured school-based t-shirts can be worn underneath
the school shirt. No bright or fluorescent-coloured t-shirts e.g., bright
pink, neon green or orange etc.</p>
<p>(e) Only canvas, sneakers or sports shoes with laces or straps are allowed.
Though students are encouraged to use shoes that are predominately black,
blue or grey - canvas, sneakers and sports shoes of choice can be of any
colour (though students are highly encouraged to avoid bright, flashy and
outlandish designs as well as colours) so long the shoes are suitable for
Physical Education lessons. Slip-on and high-cut shoes are not allowed.
Shoes with lights, wheels or wedges are also not allowed.</p>
<p>(f) Socks should be worn at all times when in school attire. Though students
are encouraged to use socks that are predominately black, white or grey
in colour - the choice of socks can be of any solid colour. Socks with
images, designs, words or large logos are not allowed. Socks should also
be long enough to cover the ankles but not the calf. students are to avoid
bright colours, flashy and outlandish designs.</p>
<p>(g) Any footwear, other than the above prescribed shoes, are not allowed
to be worn in school except for medical reasons and approved by a teacher
with supporting documentation issued by medical practitioners registered

<p>4. All students are to adhere to the following:</p>
<p>(a) Be punctual and present for the flag raising ceremony, assembly, all
lessons, activities and other school events.</p>
<p>(b) Assemble in the parade square/school hall/classroom by 7:50 a.m. It
is the responsibility of the student to personally inform his/her Form
Teacher if he/she is in school but not in the respective assembly area
due to valid reasons.</p>
<p>(c) Inform the Form Teachers or the General Office of their absence from
school by 7:50 a.m. on the day of absence.</p>
<p>(d) Submit an original copy of the Medical Certificate (MC) for the day(s)
absent from school to the Form Teacher on the day of return to school.
A clear picture of the original MC may be also be submitted via Parents
Gateway.</p>
<p>(e) Letters from parents/guardians explaining a student’s absence from
school should not exceed 5 in a semester as students’ attendance in school
is critical for them to do well in school. Students will be considered
as Absent without Valid Reason if they have submitted parent letters/emails
for more than 5 days of absence per semester or travelled overseas during
term time for family holidays. Absence without valid reason can be considered
as truancy and appropriate consequences will be meted out.</p>
<p>(f) Letters from parents/guardians cannot be used to explain absence from
tests or examinations. Absence from a test/examination without a valid
MC will result in the student getting a zero mark for the test/examination.</p>
<p>(g) Submitted MCs must be issued by a medical practitioner registered
under the Medical Registration Act or the Dental Registration Act.</p>
<p>(h) Persistent truancy is viewed as a wilful absence from school and may
result in expulsion. A student who is absent from school without any valid
reasons for three days (the days need not be consecutive), will be issued
a letter of warning.</p>
<p>5. A student who has been late without valid reasons for 5 times for the
year will be issued an advisory letter. Persistent late coming may result
in suspension from school.</p>
<p>6. Upon receiving any letter for late coming, a student who continues
to be late without any valid reasons or comes to school after 8:10 a.m.,
may not be allowed to go to class as it would be highly disruptive to lessons
that are on-going.</p>
<p>7. A student who has received a warning letter for being severely late
(i.e. after 8:10 a.m.) on 5 occasions (with days not necessarily consecutive)
and/or a warning letter for accumulating 10 instances of late coming will
be placed under the Early Bird Programme (EBP).</p>
<p>Students identified for the EBP will be required to report to school by
7:40 a.m. daily until further notice. Wilful absence from the programme
will be regarded as defiance or truancy and may result in out-of-school
suspension for a specified number of days, depending on the severity and
frequency of the individual’s late-coming offences.</p>
<p>A student under the EBP who continues to be late, may face same-day after-school
detention, in-school suspension, or out-of-school suspension, depending
on the severity and extent of the repeated late-coming offence.</p>
<p>8. Students who reach school after 8:10 a.m. would be considered as severely
late. They are to proceed to the General Office to see one of the Vice
Principals (HOD/SH for Student Management if the Vice Principals are not
in schools) to obtain approval to proceed for lessons. Students should
not proceed for lessons or activities for the day unless approval has been
given via the issuance of a late coming slip by a Vice Principal or by
HOD/SH for Student Management.</p>
<p>9. Students with persistent late coming in the previous year, who arrive
after 8:10 a.m. and have no valid reasons for being late, may not be allowed
to go to class.</p>
<p>10. Students who have been issued the late-coming slip are required to
submit these slips to their Form Teachers or Subject Teachers upon arriving
in class for recording purposes.</p>
<p>11. Students with less than 95% attendance (where absence is without valid
medical reasons) may not be allowed to sit for the End-of-Year examinations.</p>
<p>12. Poor attendance in school and persistent late coming will affect the
conduct grade and testimonial of the student.</p>
<p>13. Curriculum time is of utmost importance, as such, early release from
school or absence during curriculum time will not be approved unless it
is on compassionate grounds. Students are advised to schedule their medical
or dental appointment after curriculum time.</p>
<p>14. Students who need to be absent from school for an extended period
(continuously three or more days) during term time for valid reasons should
seek approval from the Principal/Vice-Principal by filling in a Permission
for Curriculum Absence (PCA) form. Failing which, absence from school during
this period may be considered as truancy.</p>
<p>(a) For planned absences (with valid reasons) from term time, the application
should be submitted at least 2 weeks before. The PCA form may be obtained
from the school’s General Office.</p>
<p>(b) For last minute request on compassionate grounds, students should
approach the General Office directly if in school or notify via their Form
Teachers if not in school.</p>
<p>(c) Students on Hospitalisation and/or Medical Leave need not submit the
Permission for Curriculum Absence (PCA) Form and should instead follow
the points listed out in part 4(c), 4(d) and 4(g).</p>
<p>15. Preparing and studying for tests or examinations is not a valid reason
for absence from school and such offences will have a direct impact on
the student’s conduct grade and testimonials.</p>
<p>16. Going on holidays during term time will not be considered as a valid
reason for absence from school, including lessons, CCA and school programmes.
Such offences will have a direct impact on the student’s conduct grade
and testimonials.</p>
<p>17. Attending tuition and other enrichment outside of school will not
be considered as a valid reason for absence from school, afternoon lessons
or programmes and CCA. Such offences will have a direct impact on the student’s
conduct grade and testimonials.</p>
<p>18. Attendance at detention and CWO is compulsory where assigned. Any
assigned hours must be duly completed within the stipulated time. Wilful
absence will be deemed as defiance/truancy, and the affected students will
be placed under extended detention and/or suspension from school.</p>
<p>19. Attendance at CCA is compulsory. Students who are absent from CCA
will need to produce a valid MC (refer to Point 4(g) above) for the period
of absence to the CCA teacher in-charge. Poor CCA attendance may affect
conduct grade, school/national representation in competitions, as well
as CCA points under the LEAPS system.</p>
<p>20. If a student no longer has any more lessons for the day, the earliest
time that he/she can be dismissed from school will be at 12:40 p.m.</p>
<p>21. Students who do not have any lessons in between periods should do
their own self-revision at the school library. Where there are such instances,
it will be formally arranged by the school. Students are to sign in and
out with the librarian at the library.</p>
<h4>ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIOUR</h4>
<p><strong>Rationale:&nbsp;&nbsp; To cultivate self-discipline through responsible decision making</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Students are to ensure adherence to the following at all times:</p>
<p>(a) In school:</p>
<p>(a) Students are to respect and obey all school rules and regulations.</p>
<p>(b) Students are to display exemplary conduct and behave with decorum
at all times.</p>
<p>(c) Students are to observe silence when they are in the classroom, at
the parade square or school hall for flag raising ceremony or other school
functions. They are to conduct themselves well during such gatherings where
common courtesy and respect must be accorded to all concerned including
guest speakers.</p>
<p>(d) Students must be respectful to all school staff, fellow students and
members of the community.</p>
<p>(e) Students are responsible for keeping the environment safe. The school
has zero tolerance towards actions that may hurt or harm others emotionally
or physically.</p>
<p>(f) Students are prohibited from entering any staff offices, such as the
Staff Rooms, General Office and HOD room, as well as the Staff Lounge.</p>
<p>(g) Students can enter special rooms in the school only when accompanied
by teachers.</p>
<p>(h) Students are not allowed to invite anyone into the school without
permission. All visitors to the school must obtain a Visitor Pass at the
security post and report to the General Office.</p>
<p>(i) Students are strictly not allowed to use abusive or foul language.</p>
<p>(j) Possession of any material that promotes unhealthy habits such as
gambling, violence, harassment, discrimination etc. are strictly not allowed.</p>
<p>(k) Possession and consumption of alcohol, tobacco-related products and
e-vapouriser related products, like cigarettes, e-vapourisers, e-vapouriser
pods or cartridges, are strictly prohibited by law. The school is required
by law to report all related offences to the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>(l) Possession of any incendiary items, such as lighters, paracord survival
bracelet, matchsticks, matchboxes, empty cigarette boxes, are strictly
not allowed.</p>
<p>(m) Possession and consumption of drugs are strictly prohibited by law.</p>
<p>(n) All students are not allowed to have in their possession any weapon
or weapon-like devices in school. They are also not allowed to bring any
weapon-like item that is used or intended to be used to cause harm to others.</p>
<p>(o) Cycling, skating, rollerblading, and riding skate-scooters within
the school grounds are strictly not allowed.</p>
<p>(p) Students are not to use their smartphones/smartwatches at all times
in school, including during recess, CCA, after-school programmes (e.g.
supplementary/enrichment/remedial lessons) and during all school activities
held outside of school. Smartphones/smartwatches should be kept in their
school bags (not to be held in hands or kept in pockets) at all times in
school, including during recess, CCA, after-school programmes (e.g. supplementary/enrichment/remedial
lessons) and during all school activities held outside of school. Students
are to bear the responsibility for safekeeping their own devices. For emergency
purposes, parents should contact the School’s General Office for assistance.
Unauthorized usage of smartphones/smartwatches will result in confiscation
in accordance to the School’s SOP.</p>
