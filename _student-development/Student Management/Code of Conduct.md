<h4>PHILOSOPHY AND APPROACH</h4>
<h4></h4>
<p>The code of conduct serves to nurture in our students desired values and
behaviours that are exemplary.</p>
<p>The discipline processes and systems in the school are designed to help
and guide students to think responsibly, reflect on their actions, understand
the consequences of actions as well as responsibilities and come up with
collaborative solutions to move forward. Discipline offences will have
a direct impact on conduct grade and testimonial of students.</p>
<p>The school has a clear set of rules and regulations, which together with
the school’s philosophy for discipline, are shared with the students. The
rationale for each segment of the rules and regulations have been articulated
explicitly to ensure that students do not follow rules blindly. Instead,
students should understand the intentions and reasons for these rules as
well as how these rules would serve them well in future as they progress
to the next phase of their education and lives.</p>
<p>We trust that the school’s Code of Conduct will enable students who graduate
from PCSS would leave the school as responsible young adults and citizens
who are ready to contribute to the community and the nation.</p>
<h4>ATTIRE</h4>
<p><strong>Rationale:	To present oneself well and uphold the good name of the school with pride both in and out of school</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform. Modification to
the uniform is strictly not allowed.</p>
<p>2. All students are to ensure that they are properly attired at all times
including during the school holidays and outside of school.</p>
<p>3. No external attire is allowed in school at all times.</p>
<p>4. All students are to ensure the following with regard to the school
uniform:</p>
<p>(a) Shirts and blouses must be properly buttoned up, worn neatly and smartly
at all times.</p>
<p>(b) The length of the school skirt should not be 3 cm higher than the
knees.</p>
<p>(c) The school pants/shorts/shirt/skirt is of the correct size and not
oversized, too tight or too short.</p>
<p>(d) White/black or dark coloured school-based t-shirts can be worn underneath
the school shirt. No bright or fluorescent-coloured t-shirts e.g., bright
pink, neon green or orange etc.</p>
<p>(e) Only canvas, sneakers or sports shoes with laces or straps are allowed.
Though students are encouraged to use shoes that are predominately black,
blue or grey - canvas, sneakers and sports shoes of choice can be of any
colour (though students are highly encouraged to avoid bright, flashy and
outlandish designs as well as colours) so long the shoes are suitable for
Physical Education lessons. Slip-on and high-cut shoes are not allowed.
Shoes with lights, wheels or wedges are also not allowed.</p>
<p>(f) Socks should be worn at all times when in school attire. Though students
are encouraged to use socks that are predominately black, white or grey
in colour - the choice of socks can be of any solid colour. Socks with
images, designs, words or large logos are not allowed. Socks should also
be long enough to cover the ankles but not the calf. students are to avoid
bright colours, flashy and outlandish designs.</p>
<p>(g) Any footwear, other than the above prescribed shoes, are not allowed
to be worn in school except for medical reasons and approved by a teacher
with supporting documentation issued by medical practitioners registered
under the Medical Registration Act.</p>
