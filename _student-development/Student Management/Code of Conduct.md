<h4><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>PHILOSOPHY AND APPROACH</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The code of conduct serves to nurture in our students desired values and
behaviours that are exemplary.</p>
<p>The discipline processes and systems in the school are designed to help
and guide students to think responsibly, reflect on their actions, understand
the consequences of actions as well as responsibilities and come up with
collaborative solutions to move forward. Discipline offences will have
a direct impact on conduct grade, testimonial of students</p>
<p>The school has a clear set of rules and regulations, which together with
the school’s philosophy for discipline, are shared with the students. The
rationale for each segment of the rules and regulations have been articulated
explicitly to ensure that students do not follow rules blindly. Instead,
students should understand the intentions and reasons for these rules as
well as how these rules would serve them well in future as they progress
to the next phase of their education and lives.</p>
<p>We trust that students who graduate from PCSS would leave the school as
responsible young adults and citizens who are ready to contribute to the
community and the nation.</p>
<h4>ATTIRE</h4>
<p><strong>Rationale:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To portray a positive image of oneself through personal grooming and hygiene</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are to wear the prescribed
school uniform. Modification to the uniform is strictly not allowed.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All students are to ensure that
they are properly attired at all times including during the school holidays
and outside of school.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No external attire is allowed in
school at all times.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All students are to ensure the
following with regard to the school uniform:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shirts and blouses
must be properly buttoned up, worn neatly and smartly at all times.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The length of the
school skirt should not be 3cm higher than the knees.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school pants/shorts/shirt/skirt
is of the correct size and not oversized, too tight or too short.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; White/black
or dark coloured school-based t-shirts can be worn underneath the school
shirt. No bright or fluorescent-coloured t-shirts e.g., bright pink, neon
green or orange etc.</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only canvas, sneakers
or sports shoes with laces or straps are allowed. Though students are encouraged
to use shoes that are predominately black, blue or grey - canvas, sneakers
and sports shoes of choice can be of any colour (<em>though students are highly encouraged to avoid bright, flashy and outlandish designs as well as colours</em>)
so long the shoes are suitable for Physical Education lessons. Slip-on
and high-cut shoes are not allowed. Shoes with lights, wheels or wedges
are also not allowed.</p>
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Socks
should be worn at all times when in school attire.&nbsp;Though students
are encouraged to use socks that are predominately black, white or grey
in colour - the choice of socks can be of any colour (<em>though students are highly encouraged to avoid bright, flashy and outlandish designs as well as colours</em>).
Socks with inappropriate images, logos or words are not allowed.&nbsp;Socks
should also be long enough to cover the ankles but not the calf.</p>
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any footwear, other
than the above prescribed shoes, are not allowed to be worn in school except
for medical reasons and approved by a teacher with supporting documentation
issued by medical practitioners registered under the Medical Registration
Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prescribed attire for various
school activities and events (unless otherwise specified) is as follows:</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All students are to adhere to the following:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp; Be punctual and present for the flag raising ceremony, assembly,
all lessons, activities and other school events.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp; Assemble in the parade square/school hall/classroom by 7:40
am (8:20 am on Wednesday). It is the responsibility of the student to personally
inform his/her Form Teacher if he/she is in school but not in the respective
assembly area due to valid reasons.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp; Inform the Form Teachers or the General Office of their absence
from school by 7:40 am (8:20 am on Wednesday) on the day of absence.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp; Submit an original copy of the Medical Certificate (MC) for
the day(s) absent from school to the Form Teacher on the day of return
to school.</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp; Letters from parents/guardians explaining a student’s absence
from school should not exceed 5 in a semester as students’ attendance in
school is critical for them to do well in school. Students will be considered
as absent without valid reason if they have submitted parent letters/emails
for more than 5 days of absence per semester or travelled overseas during
term time for family holidays. Absence without valid reason can be considered
as truancy and appropriate consequences will be meted out.</p>
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Letters from parents/guardians cannot be used to
explain absence from tests or examinations.&nbsp; Absence from a test/examination
without a valid MC will result in the student getting a zero mark for the
test/examination.</p>
<p>(g)&nbsp; Submitted MCs must be issued by a medical practitioner registered
under the Medical Registration Act or the Dental Registration Act.</p>
<p>(h)&nbsp; Persistent truancy is viewed as a wilful absence from school
and may result in expulsion. A student who is absent from school without
any valid reasons for three days (the days need not be consecutive), will
be issued a letter of warning.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A student who has been late without valid reason
for six times for the year will be issued an advisory letter. Persistent
late-coming may result in suspension from school.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon receiving a Warning letter for late-coming
(10 or more times late for school), a student who continues to be late
without any valid reasons or comes to school after 8:00 am and 8:30 am
(on late days), may not be allowed to go to class as it would be highly
disruptive to lessons that are on-going.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A student who is late on Wednesday (late day)
for three times (the days need not be consecutive) will be placed under
the Early Bird Programme. Students identified for the Early Bird Programme
will have to report to school by 7:40am. thereafter. Wilful absence from
the programme will be deemed as defiance/truancy, and the affected students
will be placed under detention and/or suspension from school.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students who reach school after 8:00 am would
be considered as severely late. They are to proceed to the General Office
to see one of the Vice Principals (or Student Management KPs if the Vice
Principals are not in schools) to obtain approval to proceed for lessons.
Students should not proceed for lessons or activities for the day unless
approval has been given via the issuance of a late coming slip by a Vice
Principal or by a Student Management KP.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students with late-coming records the previous
year, who arrive after 8:00 am and have no valid reasons for being late,

slip are required to submit these slips to their Form Teachers or Subject
Teachers for records purposes.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students with less than 95% attendance (where
absence is without valid medical reasons) may not be allowed to sit for
the End-of-Year examinations.</p>
<p>10. Poor attendance in school and persistent late-coming may affect the
conduct grade and testimonial of the student.</p>
<p>11. Curriculum time is of utmost importance, as such, early release from
school or absence during curriculum time will not be approved unless it
is on compassionate grounds. Students are advised to schedule their medical
or dental appointment after curriculum time.</p>
<p>12. Students who need to be absent from school for an extended period
(continuously three or more days) during term time for valid reasons should
seek approval from the Principal/Vice-Principal by filling in a Permission
for Curriculum Absence (PCA) form.&nbsp; Failing which, absence from school
during this period may be considered as truancy.</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For planned
absences (with valid reasons) from curriculum, application should be submitted
at least 2 weeks before. The PCA form may be obtained from the school’s
General Office.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For last
minute request on compassionate grounds, students should approach the General
Office directly if in school or notify via their form teachers if not in
school.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students
on Hospitalisation and/or Medical Leave need not submit the Permission
for Curriculum Absence (PCA) Form and should instead follow the points
listed out in part 5 (c), 5 (d) and 5 (g). &nbsp;</p>
<p>13. Preparing and studying for tests or examinations is not a valid reason
for absence from school and such offences will have a direct impact on
the student’s conduct grade and testimonials.</p>
<p>14. Going on holidays during term time will not be considered as a valid
reason for absence from school, including lessons, CCA and school programmes.&nbsp;
Such offences will have a direct impact on the student’s conduct grade
and testimonials.</p>
<p>15. Attending tuition and other enrichment outside of school will not
be considered as a valid reason for absence from school, afternoon lessons
or programmes and CCA. Such offences will have a direct impact on the student’s
conduct grade and testimonials.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>16. Attendance at detention and CWO is compulsory where assigned. Any
assigned hours must be duly completed within the stipulated time. Wilful
absence will be deemed as defiance/truancy, and the affected students will
be placed under extended detention and/or suspension from school.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>17. Attendance at CCA is compulsory. Students who are absent from CCA
will need to produce a valid MC (refer to Point 5g above) for the period
of absence to the CCA teacher in-charge. Poor CCA attendance may affect
conduct grade and school/national representation in competitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>18. If a student no longer has any more lessons for the day, the earliest
time that he/she can be dismissed from school will be at 12:40 pm.</p>
<p>19. Students who do not have any lessons in between periods should do
their own self-revision at the school library. Where there are such instances,
it will be formally arranged by the school. Students are to sign in and
