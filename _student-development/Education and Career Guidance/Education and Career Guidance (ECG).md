Develop students' self-directedness and confidence to explore and leverage
education and career opportunities while respecting the value of all occupations.</p>
<p><strong>• Staying relevant</strong>&nbsp;- How do I get there? Build students'
adaptability and resilience to embrace the need for lifelong learning.</p>
<h4><strong>ECG Experiences @ PCSS</strong></h4>
<p>Through the ECG Experiences, we seek to guide our students to:
<br>•become more aware of their own strengths and interests
<br>• understand the relevant courses of study at post-secondary institutions
<br>• explore different industries and careers</p>
<p>The wide variety of ECG experiences in PCSS aim to enable our students

<h4><strong>Applied Learning Module@ ITE</strong></h4>
<p>ITE’s Applied Learning Modules (ApLM@ITE), formerly known as Category
A Elective Modules (CAT A EM) are short courses developed to broaden the
learning experiences of MOE students. The 22.5-hour programme will introduce
students to ITE’s full-time Nitec and Higher Nitec courses and expose them
to possible educational progression and career pathways, enabling them
to make more informed choices upon graduation from secondary school. Through
the hands-on practical sessions, students will have the opportunity to
discover how the knowledge and skills learnt can be applied to related
industries.</p>

<p><strong>Interaction with Post-Secondary Institutions (ITE)</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;At Peicai Secondary, we emphasize helping students make informed
decisions about their educational and career pathways. Events like the
‘Start Smart’ programme, where lecturers from institutions like Temasek
Polytechnic share insights into various courses, play a vital role in this
process. Similarly, engagements with Junior Colleges give our students
a broader perspective on their post-secondary options. These interactions
allow students to explore different academic and vocational routes, empowering
them to make choices that align with their interests and strengths. By
exposing our students to a range of post-secondary institutions, we ensure
they are better equipped for their future, helping them plan their educational
journey with confidence.</p>
