<h4><strong>Interaction with Post-Secondary Institutions (ITE)</strong></h4>
<p>At Peicai Secondary, we emphasize helping students make informed decisions
about their educational and career pathways. Events like the ‘Start Smart’
programme, where lecturers from institutions like Temasek Polytechnic share
insights into various courses, play a vital role in this process. Similarly,
engagements with Junior Colleges give our students a broader perspective
on their post-secondary options. These interactions allow students to explore
different academic and vocational routes, empowering them to make choices
that align with their interests and strengths. By exposing our students
to a range of post-secondary institutions, we ensure they are better equipped
for their future, helping them plan their educational journey with confidence.</p>
