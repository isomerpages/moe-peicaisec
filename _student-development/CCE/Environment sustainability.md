<p></p><h4><strong>Environment</strong></h4><p></p>
<p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
<p>As part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, all MOE schools have embarked on the Eco Stewardship Programme (ESP) since 2021. It adopts a whole-school approach to integrating environmental sustainability, in nurturing stewards of the environment and aims to reduce carbon emissions by two-thirds as a school sector by 2030, with at least 20% of our schools to be carbon neutral.<br>The Eco Stewardship Programme builds on current environmental efforts in schools. This will be done holistically through the 4Cs:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Curriculum: </strong><p align="justify">Enhance teaching and learning of sustainability in Science and Humanities, and integrate campus sustainability features into learning resources to make learning more authentic</p></li>
<li><strong>Campus: </strong><p align="justify"> Enhance campus with sustainability features like solar panels, energy-efficient LED lights
</p></li>
<li><strong>Culture:  </strong><p align="justify"> Practise daily habits like reducing food waste and energy use, and encourage students to champion sound sustainability practices amongst peers
</p></li>
<li><strong>Community:  </strong><p align="justify"> Leverage community partnerships to offer students more environment-related learning opportunities, and better understanding of future “green jobs”
</p></li>
<p></p><h4><strong>Whole School Approach for ESP@Peicai</strong></h4>
