<h4><strong>National Education (NE)</strong></h4>
<p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
<p>In Peicai, we aim to develop in students:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A Sense of Belonging;</strong><p align="justify">where students develop a deeper understanding of who they are as Singaporeans, and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a nation.
</p></li><li><strong>A Sense of Reality;</strong><p align="justify"> where students are aware of contemporary realities — including Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities — which affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world.
</p></li><li><strong>A Sense of Hope;</strong><p align="justify"> where students have confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.
</p></li><li><strong>A Will to Act;</strong><p align="justify"> where students become active citizens who have a collective resolve and a sense of shared mission towards building a Singapore for all.
</p><h4><strong>Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p></p><p align="justify">Our Peicai NE programme aims to prepare students for a rapidly changing and interconnected nature of global society. We aim for NE to be empowering and aspirational to foster active and engaged citizens who possess qualities such as social awareness, critical thinking skills, and knowledge about local, regional, and global issues.</p>
<p></p><p align="justify">As such, the key Dispositions of National Education are integrated and aligned through the various NE Commemorative Events, namely: Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day as well as National Day. </p><hr>
<p></p><h4><strong>Key Programmes:</strong></h4>
<p><b>Total Defence Day 2023</b></p>
<p></p><p align="justify">The commemoration of Total Defence Day serves as a significant occasion to reflect on the importance of a collective effort in maintaining peace and harmony. It also emphasizes individual responsibilities in various aspects of social cohesion, emergency preparedness, community support, and vigilance, both in the physical and digital world. </p>
<p></p><p align="justify">The theme for Total Defence Day 2023 is “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”. Our CCE lessons for lower secondary this year highlighted the issue of a high level of food wastage in Singapore and how it could affect Singapore’s food security. Students shared their thoughts and perspectives on how to manage food wastage in Singapore. For upper secondary, students gained awareness of the strategies to strengthen food security. They also reflected on their thoughts and feelings about alternative food options. </p><hr>
<p><b>International Friendship Day 2023</b></p>
<p></p><p align="justify">This year’s International Friendship Day theme is “Singapore in Asia”. Students learnt how Singapore plays a crucial role in facilitating and promoting closer economic, political, social, and cultural cooperation within ASEAN and the broader Asian region. By recognising the importance of connectedness between our neighbouring countries, our students learnt how our youth can play an active role in fostering people-to-people ties, thus celebrating the region’s diversity and vibrancy and promoting the spirit of friendship and collaboration. Students were engaged in discussions to gain a deeper understanding about ASEAN member countries and its people. </p><hr>
<p><b>Racial Harmony Day 2023</b></p>
<p></p><p align="justify">Students were engaged through a multi-cultural dance performance titled ‘Synergy in Cultures’ which featured the three main ethnic dances of Singapore by Apsara Asia. Lower secondary students also learnt about the significance behind wearing ethnic attires while upper secondary students engaged in a scenario-based discussions where they reflected on how they can be more respectful and sensitive in their interactions with one another. </p><hr>
