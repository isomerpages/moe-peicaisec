<p>National Education (NE) helps to develop our students into concerned citizens who actively contribute to society. NE is incorporated into formal CCE lessons as well as other subject lessons. Through these lessons, students appreciate the historical context of Singapore&rsquo;s development, the present-day challenges it faces amidst an ever-changing global landscape, and how it strives and innovates to overcome those challenges. NE lessons are designed to encourage students to think deeply and critically about local and global issues, and share their own perspectives for wide-ranging discussions.</p>
<p>The school also commemorates the four NE events &ndash;&nbsp;<em>Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>National Day</em>&nbsp;&ndash; annually with student-led assembly programmes which are complemented with classroom-based NE lessons.</p>
