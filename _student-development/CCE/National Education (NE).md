<h4><strong>National Education (NE)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong>
</p>
<p>In Peicai, we aim to inculcate in our students:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A Sense of Belonging.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>where students develop a deeper understanding of who they are as Singaporeans,
and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a
nation.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A Sense of Reality.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>where students are aware of contemporary realities — including Singapore’s
constraints and vulnerabilities — which affect us as a nation amidst the
backdrop of a less predictable world.</p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A Sense of Hope.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>where students have confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and
the resilience to face the challenges ahead.</p>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A Will to Act.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>where students become active citizens who have a collective resolve and
a sense of shared mission towards building a Singapore for all.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>Our Peicai NE programmes aims to prepare students for a rapidly changing
and interconnected nature of global society. We aim for NE to be empowering
and aspirational to foster active and engaged citizens who possess qualities
such as social awareness, critical thinking skills, and knowledge about
local, regional, and global issues.</p>
<p>As such, the key Dispositions of National Education are integrated and
aligned through the various NE Commemorative Events, namely: Total Defence
Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day as well as National
Day.</p>

<h4><strong>Key Programmes:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>International Friendship Day 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>For the whole week of the 7<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup> April, Peicai
came together as a school to commemorate International Friendship Day (IFD).</p>
<p>The new theme for IFD from 2025 to 2027 is Singapore: Forging Friendships
in a Complex World – Singapore: Forging Friendships in a Complex World
and it was with this in mind that a range of different activities were
organised for the school.</p>
<p>At the heart of the lesson, students learnt about how the rapidly evolving
global landscape offers Singapore both opportunities and challenges and
that this makes international cooperation vital for us to address global
issues collectively and seize new opportunities. By fostering an appreciation
of different cultures and perspectives, students will be better equipped
to contribute to a cohesive and globally connected society. It was in keeping
the latter in mind that a two-part series of student led presentations
were held on Monday (7<sup>th</sup> April) and Friday (11<sup>th</sup> April).</p>
<p>On the 7<sup>th</sup> April, international student from China, Jing Yan,
and Singaporean student, Pearlynn, went up to share about their perspective
about their varying experiences making foreign and local friends here in
Singapore. On the 11<sup>th</sup> April, international student from the
Philippines, Ashely, and Singaporean student, Darian, went up to share
their experience about learning about foreign cultures here in Singapore
and abroad.</p>

<p>Students also learnt about forging meaningful connections with our neighbours
in order to help Singapore remain relevant in a complex world. They learn
the importance of embracing openness and opportunities for international
cooperation, while deepening their understanding of Singapore’s geopolitical
realities and national interests. One interesting way this was done was
through the country infographics which our foreign students helped to design
to spread more awareness about their home country.</p>

<p><strong>Racial Harmony Day 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>Racial Harmony Day was commemorated in school in Week 4 of Term 3 from
the 21<sup>st</sup> July (Monday) to 25<sup>th</sup> July (Friday).</p>
<p>The theme for Racial Harmony Day (RHD) , ‘Our People, Our Tapestry’, reminds
us that the diverse cultural threads in our society are intricately intertwined,
working together to form a vibrant and unified whole. The objective of
RHD is to help students recognise the importance of mutual understanding,
appreciation, and respect among our various ethnic communities ; all of
which are key to preserving the strength and harmony of our multicultural
society.</p>
<p>This year, our RHD commemoration continued to deepen students’ awareness
that cultural expression takes many forms. In keeping with the theme, the
focus remained on ethnic food and snacks; always a crowd favourite and
with an exciting new addition: ethnic games.</p>
<p>It was heartening to see our students and teachers coming together during
CCE lessons to bring, share and enjoy a wide array of traditional snacks
and games. The classroom celebrations were filled with laughter, curiosity,
and rich conversations. The lively demonstrations of Kabaddi, Wushu, and
Sepak Raga further engaged our students, sparking interest in traditional
ethnic sports and highlighting the diversity of expression across cultures.</p>
<p>During recess, the interactive ethnic games booth was a popular attraction,
where students enthusiastically participated in nostalgic games such as
5 Stones, Chapteh, and Congkak. Their enthusiasm and openness to explore
reflected the heart of Racial Harmony Day: &nbsp;a celebration of shared
experiences and cultural learning.</p>
<p>The commemoration would not have been possible without the dedication
of our teachers and the wholehearted participation of our students. Together,
they helped bring the theme “Our People, Our Tapestry” to life in meaningful
and memorable ways.</p>

<p><strong>National Day 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>The school commemorated National Day to mark the 60th anniversary of our
independence, a significant milestone in Singapore’s history. It was a
time to reflect on our nation’s journey and move onward together in building
our shared future as one united people.</p>
<p>This year, as Singapore turned 60, the school came together for our annual
National Day Parade, which featured a march past by students from NCC,
NPCC and Girl Guides. The celebration reaffirmed the values of multiculturalism,
boldness, resilience, and openness that have united us and enabled Singapore
to thrive over the past six decades.</p>
<p>We were also honoured to have Dr Edmond Tan, Vice-Chairperson of our School
Advisory Committee, grace the occasion as our Guest-of-Honour.</p>
<p>We were also delighted to welcome our seniors from the Lions Befrienders,
who joined us for a day of celebration and joy, with breakfast kindly sponsored
by Ya Kun Kaya Toast.</p>
<p>In the second half of the programme, Peicaians presented a series of celebratory
performances. A standout moment was the spectacular flag fly-past by our
Aeromodelling students, which thrilled the audience. The concert segment
also featured crowd favourites, including the annual Peicai’s Got Talent,
alongside vibrant Band and Modern Dance performances. Adding a fun and
educational twist to the celebration, we hosted 'How Well Do You Know Singapore’s
History? Let’s Play the Singapore Quiz, Peicai Style!' Six staff members
each paired up with a student to tackle questions about Singapore's rich
heritage, sparking curiosity, laughter, and plenty of friendly competition.</p>
<p>The celebration culminated with the school coming together as one heartbeat
in community singing of our favourite National Day songs. It was heartwarming
to see Peicaians enjoying the festivities and embracing the true spirit
of togetherness.</p>
<p>This celebration was a tribute to our shared history and values, reinforcing
our collective commitment to Singapore’s continued progress in the years
ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Total Defence Day 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of our school’s commemoration of Total Defence Day and participation
in Exercise SG Ready 2025, our students participated in the Food Resilience
Preparedness Programme in collaboration with the Singapore Food Agency
(SFA) and SATS on17 during their CCE lesson.</p>
<p>As part of the experience, each student was given a ready-to-eat (RTE)
meal to consume at ambient temperature with disposable cutleries.</p>
<p>This programme aims to prepare students for uncertainties and potential
food supply disruptions. It encourages them to be adaptable and flexible
in their food choices by being open to accommodate changes and consider
alternative food options in the event of food supply disruptions.</p>
<p>Following the experience, students shared their reflections with their
classmates through a guided discussion:</p>
<p>“The FRPP exercise was very useful as it helped ensure that we are prepared
for such situations. I liked that we were given the opportunity to experience
this beforehand. I learned to be adaptable and make the best of what is
available during such events.”</p>
<p>– Poorni, 4C4</p>
<p>“My experience during the commemoration was unforgettable. It gave me
insight into Singapore’s readiness in case of an emergency. It truly gives
me a sense of security within Singapore. It was an interesting experience
for me, and I do hope the school continues to do more things like this.”</p>

<p><strong>Total Defence Day 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Total Defence Day serves as a reminder of our shared responsibility to
safeguard the peace and harmony in our society. As Singapore commemorates
40 years of Total Defence through Exercise SG Ready, students @ Peicai
also participated in Food Disruption Exercise held on 16<sup>th</sup> February
2024. By temporarily removing meat from the menu, students were able to
experience firsthand how such changes could impact daily life and reinforce
the need for preparedness. They then shared their thoughts and opinions
about the Exercise SG through lessons carried out in the classrooms.</p>
<p>Our Secondary 2 students were also engaged in Guardians of the City strategy
card game to educate youths about Singapore’s security threats and the
importance of Total Defence. By gamifying the learning experience, it allows
students to immerse themselves in scenarios where they must navigate various
crises and apply the principles of Total Defence to overcome them.</p>

<p><strong>International Friendship Day 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>This year’s International Friendship Day theme is “Singapore in Asia”.
Students were firstly engaged in fringe activities such as creating a passport
cover which incorporates the friendship amongst ASEAN nations. Following
which, students were involved in discussions of how ASEAN nations collaborate
and provide opportunities for people to learn from one another about their
countries and cultures. In addition to that, students learnt about the
concept of transnational families. Through in-depth discussions and sharing,
students were exposed to the common experiences they may have with these
families and how students can better connect with as well as foster bonds
with people in Singapore and abroad.</p>

<p><strong>Racial Harmony Day 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Students had a meaningful RHD 2024 celebration through class party where
they brought and sampled various ethnic snacks. This hands-on experience
not only highlighted the richness of multiculturalism but also emphasized
that diversity can be celebrated in many ways. The participation of both
students and teachers in bringing and sharing ethnic snacks have made the
event more special and inclusive. In addition to that, students had the
opportunity to visit ethnic herb and spices booth which was set up at the
foyer. Through this booth, students were able to learn more about the various
spices which are commonly used in the cultural dishes</p>

<p><strong>National Day 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>This year’s National Day theme is “Together, As One United People”, highlights
the collective strength of Singaporeans and importance of every citizen
rallying together.</p>
<p>Our students participated in various lessons and fringe activities which
focus on “The Living Heritage” in Singapore. Students from the lower secondary
were tasked to design a National Day Digital Mascot and incorporate an
element of “The Living Heritage” while the upper secondary designed a stamp-inspired
digital illustration.</p>
<p>Peicai Secondary is honored to host elderlies from Lion’s Befrienders
with breakfast sponsored by Ya Kun Kaya Toast as well as our Thai counterparts
during the NDP celebration. Our National Day celebration includes a parade
segment by students from the Uniformed Groups such as NPCC, NCC (Sea) and
Girl Guides. After the parade, students were entertained with the concert
in the hall, with Peicai’s Got Talent and Community Singing as highlights
of the show.</p>
