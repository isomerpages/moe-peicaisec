<h4><strong>National Education (NE)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong>
</p>
<p>In Peicai, we aim to inculcate in our students:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A Sense of Belonging.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>where students develop a deeper understanding of who they are as Singaporeans,
and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a
nation.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A Sense of Reality.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>where students are aware of contemporary realities — including Singapore’s
constraints and vulnerabilities — which affect us as a nation amidst the
backdrop of a less predictable world.</p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A Sense of Hope.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>where students have confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and
the resilience to face the challenges ahead.</p>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A Will to Act.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>where students become active citizens who have a collective resolve and
a sense of shared mission towards building a Singapore for all.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>Our Peicai NE programmes aims to prepare students for a rapidly changing
and interconnected nature of global society. We aim for NE to be empowering
and aspirational to foster active and engaged citizens who possess qualities
such as social awareness, critical thinking skills, and knowledge about
local, regional, and global issues.</p>
<p>As such, the key Dispositions of National Education are integrated and
aligned through the various NE Commemorative Events, namely: Total Defence
Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day as well as National
Day.</p>

<h4><strong>Key Programmes:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>International Friendship Day 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>For the whole week of the 7<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup> April, Peicai
came together as a school to commemorate International Friendship Day (IFD).</p>
<p>The new theme for IFD from 2025 to 2027 is Singapore: Forging Friendships
in a Complex World – Singapore: Forging Friendships in a Complex World
and it was with this in mind that a range of different activities were
organised for the school.</p>
<p>At the heart of the lesson, students learnt about how the rapidly evolving
global landscape offers Singapore both opportunities and challenges and
that this makes international cooperation vital for us to address global
issues collectively and seize new opportunities. By fostering an appreciation
of different cultures and perspectives, students will be better equipped
to contribute to a cohesive and globally connected society. It was in keeping
the latter in mind that a two-part series of student led presentations
were held on Monday (7<sup>th</sup> April) and Friday (11<sup>th</sup> April).</p>
<p>On the 7<sup>th</sup> April, international student from China, Jing Yan,
and Singaporean student, Pearlynn, went up to share about their perspective
about their varying experiences making foreign and local friends here in
Singapore. On the 11<sup>th</sup> April, international student from the
Philippines, Ashely, and Singaporean student, Darian, went up to share
their experience about learning about foreign cultures here in Singapore
and abroad.</p>

<p>Students also learnt about forging meaningful connections with our neighbours
in order to help Singapore remain relevant in a complex world. They learn
the importance of embracing openness and opportunities for international
cooperation, while deepening their understanding of Singapore’s geopolitical
realities and national interests. One interesting way this was done was
through the country infographics which our foreign students helped to design
to spread more awareness about their home country.</p>

<p><strong>Total Defence Day 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of our school’s commemoration of Total Defence Day and participation
in Exercise SG Ready 2025, our students participated in the Food Resilience
Preparedness Programme in collaboration with the Singapore Food Agency
(SFA) and SATS on17 during their CCE lesson.</p>
<p>As part of the experience, each student was given a ready-to-eat (RTE)
meal to consume at ambient temperature with disposable cutleries.</p>
<p>This programme aims to prepare students for uncertainties and potential
food supply disruptions. It encourages them to be adaptable and flexible
in their food choices by being open to accommodate changes and consider
alternative food options in the event of food supply disruptions.</p>
<p>Following the experience, students shared their reflections with their
classmates through a guided discussion:</p>
<p>“The FRPP exercise was very useful as it helped ensure that we are prepared
for such situations. I liked that we were given the opportunity to experience
this beforehand. I learned to be adaptable and make the best of what is
available during such events.”</p>
<p>– Poorni, 4C4</p>
<p>“My experience during the commemoration was unforgettable. It gave me
insight into Singapore’s readiness in case of an emergency. It truly gives
me a sense of security within Singapore. It was an interesting experience
for me, and I do hope the school continues to do more things like this.”</p>

<p><strong>Total Defence Day 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Total Defence Day serves as a reminder of our shared responsibility to
safeguard the peace and harmony in our society. As Singapore commemorates
40 years of Total Defence through Exercise SG Ready, students @ Peicai
also participated in Food Disruption Exercise held on 16<sup>th</sup> February
2024. By temporarily removing meat from the menu, students were able to
experience firsthand how such changes could impact daily life and reinforce
the need for preparedness. They then shared their thoughts and opinions
about the Exercise SG through lessons carried out in the classrooms.</p>
<p>Our Secondary 2 students were also engaged in Guardians of the City strategy
card game to educate youths about Singapore’s security threats and the
importance of Total Defence. By gamifying the learning experience, it allows
students to immerse themselves in scenarios where they must navigate various
crises and apply the principles of Total Defence to overcome them.</p>

<p><strong>International Friendship Day 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>This year’s International Friendship Day theme is “Singapore in Asia”.
Students were firstly engaged in fringe activities such as creating a passport
cover which incorporates the friendship amongst ASEAN nations. Following
which, students were involved in discussions of how ASEAN nations collaborate
and provide opportunities for people to learn from one another about their
countries and cultures. In addition to that, students learnt about the
concept of transnational families. Through in-depth discussions and sharing,
students were exposed to the common experiences they may have with these
families and how students can better connect with as well as foster bonds
with people in Singapore and abroad.</p>

<p><strong>Racial Harmony Day 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Students had a meaningful RHD 2024 celebration through class party where
they brought and sampled various ethnic snacks. This hands-on experience
not only highlighted the richness of multiculturalism but also emphasized
that diversity can be celebrated in many ways. The participation of both
students and teachers in bringing and sharing ethnic snacks have made the
event more special and inclusive. In addition to that, students had the
opportunity to visit ethnic herb and spices booth which was set up at the
foyer. Through this booth, students were able to learn more about the various
spices which are commonly used in the cultural dishes</p>
