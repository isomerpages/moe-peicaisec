<h4><strong>National Education (NE)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong>
</p>
<p>In Peicai, we aim to inculcate in our students:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A Sense of Belonging.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>where students develop a deeper understanding of who they are as Singaporeans,
and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a
nation.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A Sense of Reality.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>where students are aware of contemporary realities — including Singapore’s
constraints and vulnerabilities — which affect us as a nation amidst the
backdrop of a less predictable world.</p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A Sense of Hope.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>where students have confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and
the resilience to face the challenges ahead.</p>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A Will to Act.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>where students become active citizens who have a collective resolve and
a sense of shared mission towards building a Singapore for all.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>Our Peicai NE programmes aims to prepare students for a rapidly changing
and interconnected nature of global society. We aim for NE to be empowering
and aspirational to foster active and engaged citizens who possess qualities
such as social awareness, critical thinking skills, and knowledge about
local, regional, and global issues.</p>
<p>As such, the key Dispositions of National Education are integrated and
aligned through the various NE Commemorative Events, namely: Total Defence
Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day as well as National
Day.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Key Programmes:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Total Defence Day 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Total Defence Day serves as a reminder of our shared responsibility to
safeguard the peace and harmony in our society. As Singapore commemorates
40 years of Total Defence through Exercise SG Ready, students @ Peicai
also participated in Food Disruption Exercise held on 16<sup>th</sup> February
2024. By temporarily removing meat from the menu, students were able to
experience firsthand how such changes could impact daily life and reinforce
the need for preparedness. They then shared their thoughts and opinions
about the Exercise SG through lessons carried out in the classrooms.</p>
<p>Our Secondary 2 students were also engaged in Guardians of the City strategy
card game to educate youths about Singapore’s security threats and the
importance of Total Defence. By gamifying the learning experience, it allows
students to immerse themselves in scenarios where they must navigate various
crises and apply the principles of Total Defence to overcome them.</p>

<p><strong>International Friendship Day 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>This year’s International Friendship Day theme is “Singapore in Asia”.
Students were firstly engaged in fringe activities such as creating a passport
cover which incorporates the friendship amongst ASEAN nations. Following
which, students were involved in discussions of how ASEAN nations collaborate
and provide opportunities for people to learn from one another about their
countries and cultures. In addition to that, students learnt about the
concept of transnational families. Through in-depth discussions and sharing,
students were exposed to the common experiences they may have with these
families and how students can better connect with as well as foster bonds
with people in Singapore and abroad.</p>

<p><strong>Racial Harmony Day 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Students had a meaningful RHD 2024 celebration through class party where
they brought and sampled various ethnic snacks. This hands-on experience
not only highlighted the richness of multiculturalism but also emphasized
that diversity can be celebrated in many ways. The participation of both
students and teachers in bringing and sharing ethnic snacks have made the
event more special and inclusive. In addition to that, students had the
opportunity to visit ethnic herb and spices booth which was set up at the
foyer. Through this booth, students were able to learn more about the various
spices which are commonly used in the cultural dishes</p>

<p><strong>National Day 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>This year’s National Day theme is “Together, As One United People”, highlights
the collective strength of Singaporeans and importance of every citizen
rallying together.</p>
<p>Our students participated in various lessons and fringe activities which
focus on “The Living Heritage” in Singapore. Students from the lower secondary
were tasked to design a National Day Digital Mascot and incorporate an
element of “The Living Heritage” while the upper secondary designed a stamp-inspired
digital illustration.</p>
<p>Peicai Secondary is honored to host elderlies from Lion’s Befrienders
with breakfast sponsored by Ya Kun Kaya Toast as well as our Thai counterparts
during the NDP celebration. Our National Day celebration includes a parade
segment by students from the Uniformed Groups such as NPCC, NCC (Sea) and
Girl Guides. After the parade, students were entertained with the concert
in the hall, with Peicai’s Got Talent and Community Singing as highlights
of the show.</p>
