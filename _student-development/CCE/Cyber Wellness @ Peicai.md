<h4><strong>MOE's Cyber Wellness Framework</strong></h4>
<p><p align="justify">In order for the students to &lsquo;sense&rsquo; and &lsquo;think&rsquo;, students are provided opportunities to analyze, evaluate and reflect on Cyber Wellness issues. Platforms are also provided to allow students to translate their understanding into actions that will keep them safe while online. These platforms aim to let students take on the role as advocates to share the messages of Cyber Wellness with their peers, family and public.&nbsp;</p>
