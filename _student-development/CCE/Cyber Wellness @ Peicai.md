<p>The aim of the Cyber Wellness programme is to develop Peicaians into discerning and responsible ICT users who are able to protect themselves and be responsible for their well-being in cyberspace. The school adopts MOE&rsquo;s Cyber Wellness Framework in educating our students on Cyber Wellness. This framework focuses on three key processes:&nbsp;<em>Sense, Think</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Act</em>.</p>

<p>For students to &lsquo;sense&rsquo; and &lsquo;think&rsquo;, we provide ample opportunities for them to analyse, evaluate and reflect on Cyber Wellness issues during CCE lessons.</p>
<p>Platforms are also provided to allow students to translate their understanding into actions that will keep them safe while online. These platforms aim to let students take on the role as advocates to share the messages of Cyber Wellness with their peers, family and public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents may refer to ICT Connection (a website created by MOE for parents) for a list of guides and tips, resources and useful links to reinforce Cyber Wellness education at home.&nbsp;</p>
