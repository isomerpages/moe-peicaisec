<h4><strong>International Friendship Day 2025</strong></h4>
<p>For the whole week of the 7<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup> April, Peicai
came together as a school to commemorate International Friendship Day (IFD).</p>
<p>The new theme for IFD from 2025 to 2027 is Singapore: Forging Friendships
in a Complex World – Singapore: Forging Friendships in a Complex World
and it was with this in mind that a range of different activities were
organised for the school.</p>
<p>At the heart of the lesson, students learnt about how the rapidly evolving
global landscape offers Singapore both opportunities and challenges and
that this makes international cooperation vital for us to address global
issues collectively and seize new opportunities. By fostering an appreciation
of different cultures and perspectives, students will be better equipped
to contribute to a cohesive and globally connected society. It was in keeping
the latter in mind that a two-part series of student led presentations
were held on Monday (7<sup>th</sup> April) and Friday (11<sup>th</sup> April).</p>
<p>On the 7<sup>th</sup> April, international student from China, Jing Yan,
and Singaporean student, Pearlynn, went up to share about their perspective
about their varying experiences making foreign and local friends here in
Singapore. On the 11<sup>th</sup> April, international student from the
Philippines, Ashely, and Singaporean student, Darian, went up to share
their experience about learning about foreign cultures here in Singapore
and abroad.</p>

<p>Students also learnt about forging meaningful connections with our neighbours
in order to help Singapore remain relevant in a complex world. They learn
the importance of embracing openness and opportunities for international
cooperation, while deepening their understanding of Singapore’s geopolitical
realities and national interests. One interesting way this was done was
through the country infographics which our foreign students helped to design
to spread more awareness about their home country.</p>

<p>During lessons, lower secondary students were tasked to design posters
about the importance of fostering international friendships and to also
better understand the concept of how they can remain open to embracing
friends and experiences from diverse places other than Singapore.</p>

<p>Upper secondary students on the other hand spend some time during lesson

and about the various ways in which Singapore can forget greater ties with
her neighbours.</p>
