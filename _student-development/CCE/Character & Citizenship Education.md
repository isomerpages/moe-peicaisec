CCE is central to the Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes. At the heart of CCE is the teaching of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students as they prepare to take on the challenges of a fast-evolving world beyond the school. </p>
