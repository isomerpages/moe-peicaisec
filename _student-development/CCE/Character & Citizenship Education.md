<h4><strong>Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>In Peicai, we aim to inculcate in our students:</p>
<p><strong>1) Good Character</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are enabled to have a sound moral compass, a strong sense of
right and wrong, think critically and ethically, be discerning in judgement,
take&nbsp;responsibility for choices and actions, be caring towards others
and strive for excellence.</p>
<p><strong>2) Resilience and Social-Emotional Well-Being</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are enabled to have a balanced sense of self, form healthy relationships,
be resilient when faced with challenges, find meaning in life and have
a&nbsp;sense of gratitude and appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>3) Active Citizenship</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are enabled to develop a strong national identity based on a
sense of belonging to the nation, a sense of hope in themselves and the
future, an&nbsp;awareness of the reality of Singapore's vulnerabilities
and constraints, and the will to act on improving the lives of others and
building a future for&nbsp;our nation.</p>
<p><strong>4) Future Readiness</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are enabled to have a sense of purpose in life, develop the dispositions
of adaptability and lifelong learning so as to be able to navigate&nbsp;education
and career pathways purposefully and take on the challenges of the future,
including the world of work.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) forms an integral part of
every student’s school experience. CCE is central to the Framework for
21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes. At the heart of CCE is
the teaching of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus
on developing a sense of purpose in our students as they prepare to take
on the challenges of a fast-evolving world beyond the school.</p>
