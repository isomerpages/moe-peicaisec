<p></p><p align="justify">Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) forms an integral part of every studentâ€™s school experience. At the heart of CCE is the teaching of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students as they prepare to take on the challenges of a fast-evolving world beyond the school.</p>
