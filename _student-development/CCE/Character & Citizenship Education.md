<p>Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) forms an integral part of every student&rsquo;s school experience. At the heart of CCE is the development of the 21st Century Competencies in students as they prepare to take on the challenges of a fast-evolving world beyond the school.</p>

<p>Dedicated CCE lessons each week are used to discuss a variety of values-based issues, including&nbsp;<em>Cyberwellness (CW), Education &amp; Career Guidance (ECG), National Education (NE) and Sexuality Education (SEd)</em>. These discussions are led by the students&rsquo; Form Teacher(s) who also serve as their Character Coach in school. Apart from CCE lessons, Form Teachers also build strong, positive teacher-student relationships (TSR) with their students through Heart-to-Heart Conversations carried out 3 days a week during the Silent Reading Programme.</p>

<p>Classroom-based CCE lessons are supplemented with meaningful and engaging level or whole-school assembly programmes provided by school personnel or external organizations.</p>
<p>Voices &amp; Visions (V&amp;V) is a unique feature of the CCE experience in the school. During these Friday morning sessions, staff or students share their reflections on a wide range of themes. For students, V&amp;V is an excellent opportunity for them to embrace the challenge of public speaking while working together with their classmates to put together a creative and engaging sharing.</p>
