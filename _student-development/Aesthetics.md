<p><strong>Aesthetics</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>In Peicai, we aim to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Nurture in students a keen sense of aesthetics and an appreciation for
the Arts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide diverse experiences in the Arts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop students’ social and emotional competencies through the practice
of the Arts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignite creativity and develop the pursuit for excellence</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Aesthetics curriculum in Peicai provides students with opportunities
to explore various Art forms – visual, performative, and musical, to communicate
their thoughts and ideas. Students are exposed to a range of learning experiences.
We strive to spark curiosity and creativity in students, developing and
enhancing their artistic skills through our diverse Arts programmes. Students
cultivate an enhanced appreciation for the artistic discipline which strengthens
their character and holistic development.</p>
