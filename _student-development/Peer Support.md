<h3><strong>Peer Support and Relationships (PSR) @ Peicai</strong></h3>
<p>Supportive peer relationships form a critical part of the network of positive
relationships in school. Peers are a significant source of support for
most students and especially so for adolescents as they are more likely
to turn to their friends rather than adults for help. With Peer Support
and Relationships (PSR), students participate in fostering strong bonds
of friendships and a sense of belonging to the school community (peer bonding),
provide practical help, and social-emotional support to one another (peer
helping) and promote positive mindsets, pro-social behaviours both online
and offline, well-being and role-model good character (peer influencing).
Taken together, these efforts contribute to the building of a caring and
supportive peer culture, by students for students.</p>

<h4><strong>PSR Implementation</strong></h4>
<p>There are two tiers of PSR implementation:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><u>Tier 1 - Programmes catered for all students</u>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every student can be a peer supporter with explicit teaching of basic
PSR knowledge and skills, and provision of opportunities for students to
demonstrate PSR.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><u>Tier 2 - Programmes for students selected for Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) programme</u>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PSLs make up one of the three student leadership wings in our school.
These leaders undergo experiential development to become more adept at
skills and dispositions in the three PSR domains.</p>

<p>The Conflict Resolution workshop aimed to equip students with essential
skills and dispositions for managing conflicts between peers in a school
environment. Participants explored different types of conflicts, such as
misunderstandings, disagreements, and social tensions, while identifying
possible causes like miscommunication and peer pressure. The workshop emphasized
the importance of recognizing these conflicts early on and understanding
their roots. Students practiced using affective statements—expressing feelings
and needs in a clear and respectful manner—to communicate effectively with
peers. Through interactive role-playing scenarios, they learned to express
their emotions constructively, promoting empathy and fostering healthier,
more positive relationships within the school community.</p>
