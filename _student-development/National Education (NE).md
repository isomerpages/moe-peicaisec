<h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4>
<p>In Peicai, we aim to develop in students:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A Sense of Belonging;</strong><p align="justify">where students develop a deeper understanding of who they are as Singaporeans, and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a nation.
</p></li><li><strong>A Sense of Reality;</strong><p align="justify"> where students are aware of contemporary realities — including Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities — which affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world.
</p></li><li><strong>A Sense of Hope;</strong><p align="justify"> where students have confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.
</p></li><li><strong>A Will to Act;</strong><p align="justify"> where students become active citizens who have a collective resolve and a sense of shared mission towards building a Singapore for all.
</p><h4><strong>Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p></p><p align="justify">Considering the current local and global context, it is recognised that NE has to be empowering and aspirational, allowing for individual sense-making so as to nurture active and engaged citizens, who are socially aware, skilled in critical thinking, and informed about local, regional, and global issues.</p>
<p></p><p align="justify">As such, the key Dispositions of National Education are integrated and aligned through the various NE Commemorative Events, namely: Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day as well as National Day.</p>
