<h4><strong>Environment</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, all MOE schools have embarked
on the <strong>Eco Stewardship Programme (ESP)</strong> since 2021. It adopts
a whole-school approach to integrating environmental sustainability, in
nurturing stewards of the environment and aims to reduce carbon emissions
by two-thirds as a school sector by 2030, with at least 20% of our schools
to be carbon neutral.</p>
<p>The Eco Stewardship Programme builds on current environmental efforts
in schools. This will be done holistically through the 4Cs:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Curriculum: Enhance teaching and learning of sustainability in Science
and Humanities, and integrate campus sustainability features into learning
resources to make learning more authentic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Campus: Enhance campus with sustainability features like solar panels,
energy-efficient LED lights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Culture: Practise daily habits like reducing food waste and energy use,
and encourage students to champion sound sustainability practices amongst
peers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community: Leverage community partnerships to offer students more environment-related
learning opportunities, and better understanding of future “green jobs"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Whole School Approach for ESP@Peicai</strong>
</p>
<p>In Peicai Secondary School, the ESP was officially rolled out in 2023
where environmental programmes and activities are designed to meet the
different needs of the students with support from various stakeholders.
Below shows a summary of the whole school approach for ESP@Peicai.</p>
<p>Every Peicaian will have the opportunity to learn and participate in environment
programmes through <strong>Tier 1 experiences</strong> such as the mass celebration
of environmental days such as World Water Day and Earth Day, assembly programmes
as well as exhibitions in the foyer. They can also participate in school-wide
recycling programmes such as “SembEnviro Plastic Recycling League” and
the “Pass-it-on Bazaar”.</p>
<p>There will also be customised programmes for different levels in <strong>Tier 2 experiences</strong>,
such as curriculum links and activities on environmental-related topics
in Geography and Science.</p>
<p>For <strong>Tier 3 experiences</strong>, Environment Heads are elected
as part of the class committee. They would have opportunities to hone their
leadership skills through leadership training as well as running of schoolwide
programmes.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes:</strong></h4>

</p>
<p><strong>Climate Crisis Challenge 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>The Climate Change Challenge (CCC) is a nationwide competition that encourages
secondary school students to create innovative solutions for Singapore’s
environmental resilience and global sustainability. It offers valuable
opportunities to enhance knowledge, teamwork, problem-solving, and presentation
skills while fostering entrepreneurship and creative thinking to tackle
climate change.</p>

<p>Our students proposed creating an app called GreenTrack to address Singapore’s
high carbon footprint by making climate action fun and engaging for students.
The app begins with a survey to measure each user’s carbon footprint and
then offers personalized daily challenges—such as using public transport
or choosing sustainable foods. Users earn rewards like discounts and certificates,
while features like leaderboards and social recognition foster friendly
competition. Integrated with school activities, GreenTrack aims to transform
environmental awareness into lasting, positive habits through technology
and community engagement.</p>

<p><strong>Go Green Challenge 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Environment Heads acted as ambassadors for environmental advocacy
and education. They created informative posters to raise awareness of environmental
and sustainability issues and took the lead in spearheading and maintaining
the “Green Wall” in their classrooms— a dedicated space to inspire and
engage their peers in eco-conscious practices.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Singapore Youth Water Conference 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Peicai Environment Heads participated in the Singapore Youth Water Conference
2024, organized by Raffles Institution. Titled “Singapore’s Water Future:
Challenges and Opportunities for the Next Generation,” the forum emphasized
the importance of water sustainability and management practices, such as
desalination and NEWater, which Singapore uses to address water scarcity.
The conference also highlighted future challenges like climate change and
the need for proactive solutions to ensure water security. Key topics included
the role of community involvement, youth engagement, and the use of technology,
such as drones and AI, in achieving water conservation goals.</p>
<p>Following the conference, our Environment Heads shared these insights
with their schoolmates during an assembly. They called for students to
adopt new water-saving practices and facilitated discussions on how the
school community can improve its water conservation efforts.</p>
