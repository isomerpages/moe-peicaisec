<p>As part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, all MOE schools have embarked
on the Eco Stewardship Programme (ESP) since 2021. It adopts a whole-school
approach to integrating environmental sustainability, in nurturing stewards
of the environment and aims to reduce carbon emissions by two-thirds as
a school sector by 2030, with at least 20% of our schools to be carbon
neutral.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Eco Stewardship Programme builds on current environmental efforts
in schools. This will be done holistically through the 4Cs:</p>

<p><strong>Whole School Approach for ESP@Peicai</strong>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>In Peicai Secondary School, the ESP was officially rolled out in 2023
where environmental programmes and activities are designed to meet the
different needs of the students with support from various stakeholders.
Below shows a summary of the whole school approach for ESP@Peicai.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every Peicaian will have the opportunity to learn and participate in environment
programmes through <strong>Tier 1 experiences </strong>such as the mass
celebration of environmental days such as World Water Day and Earth Day,
assembly programmes as well as exhibitions in the foyer. They can also
participate in school-wide recycling programmes such as “SembEnviro Plastic
Recycling League” and the “Pass-it-on Bazaar”.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There will also be customised programmes for different levels in <strong>Tier 2 experiences</strong>,
such as curriculum links and activities on environmental-related topics
in Geography and Science.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For <strong>Tier 3 experiences</strong>, Environment Heads are elected
as part of the class committee. They would have opportunities to hone their
leadership skills through leadership training as well as running of schoolwide
programmes. In 2023-2024, selected Environment Heads also had the opportunity
to propose and implement a community e-waste project in Serangoon.</p>

<h4><strong>Key Programmes:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>World Water Day 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>World Water Day is a global event dedicated to raising awareness about
the importance of freshwater and advocating for the sustainable management
of water resources. This year’s theme centers on addressing water scarcity,
a critical issue affecting millions of people around the world.</p>
<p><u>Educating on Water Scarcity<br></u>Water scarcity refers to the lack
of sufficient and safe water supplies to meet the needs of a growing population.
Factors such as climate change, over-extraction of groundwater, pollution,
and inefficient water management contribute to this problem, leading to
droughts, food shortages, and health risks. During World Water Day, students
became more aware of water scarcity’s causes and effects, emphasizing the
need for conservation and responsible water use.</p>
<p><u>Innovative Water Solutions</u>
<br>As part of World Water Day commemoration, focus is placed on exploring
innovative solutions to tackle water scarcity. These solutions include
advancements like desalination technologies, rainwater harvesting systems,
wastewater recycling, and smart irrigation methods that optimize water
use in agriculture. Our environment heads shared a few innovative solutions
that they had found with their class.</p>
<p><u>Student-Led Research and Solutions</u>
<br>Students were also encouraged to further research and present solutions
to specific water scarcity issues through their self-produced documentary
or TED talk. They could also choose to write a shape poem to advocate more
about the various Innovative Water Solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Earth Day 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Earth Day serves as a reminder to protect our planet and raise awareness
about environmental challenges. A major focus of this year’s commemoration
is addressing microplastic pollution—a growing concern that affects ecosystems,
wildlife, and human health.</p>
<p><u>Educating on Microplastic Pollution<br></u>Microplastics are tiny plastic
particles, often less than 5mm in size, that result from the breakdown
of larger plastic waste or are intentionally manufactured in products like
cosmetics and clothing. These particles pollute oceans, rivers, and even
the air we breathe, posing a threat to marine life and eventually entering
the human food chain. Educational initiatives during Earth Day highlight
the dangers of microplastic pollution and encourage reducing plastic use
and supporting policies that limit microplastic release.</p>
<p><u>Plastic Audits<br></u>Students also conduct plastic audits, where they
assess their plastic consumption and waste generation. This process helps
identify where single-use plastics can be eliminated, guiding efforts to
adopt reusable or eco-friendly alternatives and raise awareness about personal
plastic footprints.</p>
<p><u>Upcycling Projects</u>
<br>Upcycling projects offer a creative way to tackle plastic waste. By repurposing
used plastic items, such as bottles, containers, or packaging, students
created new products like planters, storage bins, or even art. Upcycling
not only helps divert plastic waste from landfills and oceans but also
fosters innovative approaches to sustainability by encouraging people to
see the value in reusing materials.</p>

<p>Peicai Environment Heads participated in the Singapore Youth Water Conference
2024, organized by Raffles Institution. Titled “Singapore’s Water Future:
Challenges and Opportunities for the Next Generation,” the forum emphasized
the importance of water sustainability and management practices, such as
desalination and NEWater, which Singapore uses to address water scarcity.
The conference also highlighted future challenges like climate change and
the need for proactive solutions to ensure water security. Key topics included
the role of community involvement, youth engagement, and the use of technology,
such as drones and AI, in achieving water conservation goals.</p>
<p>Following the conference, our Environment Heads shared these insights
with their schoolmates during an assembly. They called for students to
adopt new water-saving practices and facilitated discussions on how the
school community can improve its water conservation efforts.</p>
