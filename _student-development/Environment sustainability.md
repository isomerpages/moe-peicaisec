<p></p><h4><strong>Environment</strong></h4><p></p>
<p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
<p>As part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, all MOE schools have embarked on the Eco Stewardship Programme (ESP) since 2021. It adopts a whole-school approach to integrating environmental sustainability, in nurturing stewards of the environment and aims to reduce carbon emissions by two-thirds as a school sector by 2030, with at least 20% of our schools to be carbon neutral.<br>The Eco Stewardship Programme builds on current environmental efforts in schools. This will be done holistically through the 4Cs:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Curriculum: </strong><p align="justify">Enhance teaching and learning of sustainability in Science and Humanities, and integrate campus sustainability features into learning resources to make learning more authentic</p></li>
<li><strong>Campus: </strong><p align="justify"> Enhance campus with sustainability features like solar panels, energy-efficient LED lights
</p></li>
<li><strong>Culture:  </strong><p align="justify"> Practise daily habits like reducing food waste and energy use, and encourage students to champion sound sustainability practices amongst peers
</p></li>
<li><strong>Community:  </strong><p align="justify"> Leverage community partnerships to offer students more environment-related learning opportunities, and better understanding of future “green jobs”
</p></li>
<p></p><h4><strong>Whole School Approach for ESP@Peicai</strong></h4>
<p>In Peicai Secondary School, the ESP was officially rolled out in 2023 where environmental programmes and activities are designed to meet the different needs of the students with support from various stakeholders. Below shows a summary of the whole school approach for ESP@Peicai. </p>

<p>Every Peicaian will have the opportunity to learn and participate in environment programmes through Tier 1 experiences such as the mass celebration of environmental days such as World Water Day and Earth Day, assembly programmes as well as exhibitions in the foyer. They can also participate in school-wide recycling programmes such as “SembEnviro Plastic Recycling League” and the “Pass-it-on Bazaar”. </p>
<p>There will also be customised programmes for different levels in Tier 2 experiences, such as curriculum links and activities on environmental-related topics in Geography and Science, or differentiated level activities such as Earth Day Bingo designed by various Environment Heads from different levels.</p>
<p>For<b>Tier 3 experiences,</b> Environment Heads are elected as part of the class committee. They would have opportunities to hone their leadership skills through leadership training as well as running of schoolwide programmes. In 2023-2024, selected Environment Heads also had the opportunity to propose and implement a community e-waste project in Serangoon.</p>
<p></p><h4><strong>Key Programmes:</strong></h4>
<p>In 2023, the newly appointed Environment Heads exercised their creativity and used recycled materials to set up recycling corners in their classroom. Here is one of the best recycling bins from class 4C4 2023.</p>

<p>Here are some of our school-wide recycling projects for “SembEnviro Plastic Recycling League” where we collected a pure stream of plastic waste for proper recycling, and the “Pass-it-On Bazaar” where students can donate their old textbooks to their juniors to use the following year, with the leftover books being donated to “NTUC Share-A-Textbook Drive”.</p>
