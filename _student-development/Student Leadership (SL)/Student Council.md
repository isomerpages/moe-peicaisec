<p dir="ltr">Guided by the principle that leadership is a personal choice, the school encourages students to nominate themselves to embark on the journey of being a leader through the Student Council. By lowering the barriers of entry to leadership, the school endeavours to equip all students with the competencies necessary for success in the 21st century.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to the leadership principles of the Student Leadership Challenge, Student Councillors are equipped with practical skills like public speaking, group facilitation and project management. This is the platform they stand on when they plan and execute school-wide events, like Secondary One Orientation Camp, NE events and Teachers&rsquo; Day Celebrations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Catering to a wide range of aptitudes and attitudes, Student Councillors who want to be challenged further can apply to be in the Student Council Executive Committee or aim to achieve the rank of Senior Student Councillor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The school actively recognises the contributions of Student Councillors through various school-based (e.g. School Contribution Awards) and MOE-based (e.g. EAGLES, LEAPS2.0, ECHA) platforms.</p>

<h4><strong>EXCO Leadership Challenge 2020</strong></h4>
<p>The 12th Student Council Executive Committee came together for the annual EXCO leadership training. Over the course of the 2 days, EXCO12 modelled, challenged, inspired, enabled and encouraged. Taking steps towards building their EXCO family, EXCO12 is raring and ready to leader the Student Council forward!</p>
<p>&ldquo;ELC20 was very eye-opening for me as I got to know my fellow EXCOs better and understand why they are how they are. It reaffirmed my hope that EXCO12 would get closer as time goes by and become the family that I know we can be!&rdquo; &ndash; Lois Lio, 3C1, Hd Logistics, EXCO12</p>

<h4><strong>Teachers' Day Celebrations 2020 - Wanderlust</strong></h4>
<p>Despite the challenge of 2020, the Student Council challenged the processed and ith a live virtual concert. The Student Council brought the school together to celebrate the impact the teachers have made in the lives of all Peicaians.</p>
<p>"We know that the staff members of our school have sacrificed so much for the sake of us students and that nothing we do can truly repay them. Through this small effort, the Council hopes to represent the student body in appreciating them. To my fellow Peicaians, instead of us appreciating our teachers annually, just once a year, why not make it a daily affair. Truth be told, I think our teachers would appreciate our small gestures of gratitude on a daily basis rather than a once-off grand affair. As we approach the rest of the year, let&rsquo;s take the initiative and make it habit to do it daily." - Kieron Lye, 3C1, President, EXCO12</p>
