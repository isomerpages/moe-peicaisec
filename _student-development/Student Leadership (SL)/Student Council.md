<p dir="ltr">Guided by the principle that leadership is a personal choice, the school encourages students to nominate themselves to embark on the journey of being a leader through the Student Council. By lowering the barriers of entry to leadership, the school endeavours to equip all students with the competencies necessary for success in the 21st century.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to the leadership principles of the Student Leadership Challenge, Student Councillors are equipped with practical skills like public speaking, group facilitation and project management. This is the platform they stand on when they plan and execute school-wide events, like Secondary One Orientation Camp, NE events and Teachers&rsquo; Day Celebrations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Catering to a wide range of aptitudes and attitudes, Student Councillors who want to be challenged further can apply to be in the Student Council Executive Committee or aim to achieve the rank of Senior Student Councillor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The school actively recognises the contributions of Student Councillors through various school-based (e.g. School Contribution Awards) and MOE-based (e.g. EAGLES, LEAPS2.0, ECHA) platforms.</p>
