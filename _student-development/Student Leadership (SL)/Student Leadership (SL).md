<p>Student Leadership at Peicai Secondary School stands on the belief that every student has the potential to be developed into a leader. This leads us to offer numerous leadership opportunities for students to embrace the challenge of being a leader, be it at class, CCA or school-wide platforms. We adopt Kouzes and Posner&rsquo;s Student Leadership Challenge model to guide our leadership curriculum as it aligns perfectly with our core belief &ndash; students can become leaders not because they have the character traits of one but rather, by practising the actions that great leaders do.</p>
