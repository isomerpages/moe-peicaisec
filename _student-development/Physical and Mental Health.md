<p><b>Physical and Mental Health</b></p>
<p><b>Approach</b></p>
In Peicai, we aim to develop in our students a holistic approach to supporting their well-being, covering physical health, social and emotional development and psychological support when necessary.<br>
<p><b>Curriculum</b></p>
<ul><li> 
We strengthen students’ mental health through lessons on Character and Citizenship, Form Teacher Time and Physical Education. </li>
<li>We build character in students through experiential learning platforms such as Co-Curricular Activities, Values-in-Action programme and outdoor education.
</li><li>We teach students social and emotional competencies such as relationship management, stress management and help-seeking skills, which are then put into practice when students engage in various school activities.</li></ul>
Teachers monitor the well-being of students and work closely with parents and school counsellors to render additional support to those who need it. Schools also work with partners such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), mental health professionals and Family Service Centres to support students and their families within the community.
<p><b>Character and Citizenship Education 2021</b></p>
The refreshed Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum has been progressively implemented in schools since 2021. <br><br>
Mental Health Education is one of the key features of the CCE curriculum. Through these lessons, students are equipped with knowledge and skills to build their resilience, strengthen their mental well-being and resolve their challenges.<br><br>
For example, students learn to differentiate normal stress from distress and mental illness. They learn to break negative thinking patterns, overcome social emotional problems and seek help when they need to. Students are also taught to stand up against stigma around mental health issues.<br><br>
