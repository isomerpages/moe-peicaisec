<p><strong>Physical and Mental Health</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>In Peicai, we aim to develop in our students a holistic approach to supporting
their well-being, covering physical health, social and emotional development
and psychological support when necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We strengthen students’ mental health through lessons on Character and
Citizenship, Form Teacher Time and Physical Education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We build character in students through experiential learning platforms
such as Co-Curricular Activities, Values-in-Action programme and outdoor
education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We teach students social and emotional competencies such as relationship
management, stress management and help-seeking skills, which are then put
into practice when students engage in various school activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers monitor the well-being of students and work closely with parents
and school counsellors to render additional support to those who need it.
Schools also work with partners such as the Ministry of Social and Family
Development (MSF), mental health professionals and Family Service Centres
to support students and their families within the community.</p>
<p><strong>World Sleep Day Commemoration</strong>
</p>
<p>World sleep day is commemorated on the 14th of March.&nbsp; It is an annual
event held by the World Sleep Day Committee of the World Sleep Society,
since 2008. The goal of World Sleep Day is to celebrate the benefits of
good sleeping habits and to promote the prevention of management of sleep
disorders.</p>
<p>Four fun facts about World Sleep Day:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Studies show that students who get enough rest perform better in school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The world record for the longest time without sleep is 11 days, however,
experts warn against sleep deprivation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The longest and most vivid dreams happen during the REM (Rapid Eye Movement)
sleep stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking a 20-minutes short nap can boost alertness, mood and creativity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Signs that you are not getting enough sleep:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Slow reaction time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trouble paying attention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Difficulty thinking and being logical</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mood change, irritability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anxiety or Depression</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor judgement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced social activity due to tiredness</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to start healthy sleep habits?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>No screens an hour before bed: If you are aiming for a 10pm bedtime, aim
to switch off the TV and turn your phone on Do Not Disturb at 9pm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated timers: Set your phone to ‘night shift’ mode after dinner, to
limit your blue light exposure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wind down your body: A quick five-minute stretching session can relieve
stress and improve your sleep quality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set an alarm for sleep: Most adults need at least 7-8 hours of sleep each
night to truly reset. Set a daily alarm to remind you it is time for bed
at a reasonable hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eat early: Try not to eat large meals an hour before bed. This leads to
more awakenings and lower sleep quality</p>
</li>

<p>To conclude our World Sleep Day commemoration, we launched a challenge
inviting Peicaians to share their best practical sleep tips. Our goal was
to create a peer-to-peer learning platform where students could learn from
their schoolmates' effective sleep habits. We received numerous insightful
submissions and selected a set of entries. These winning tips were then
compiled into an informative poster to inspire the broader school community.</p>

<p><strong>Character and Citizenship Education 2021</strong>
</p>
<p>The refreshed Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum has
been progressively implemented in schools since 2021.
<br>
<br>Mental Health Education is one of the key features of the CCE curriculum.
Through these lessons, students are equipped with knowledge and skills
to build their resilience, strengthen their mental well-being and resolve
their challenges.
<br>
<br>For example, students learn to differentiate normal stress from distress
and mental illness. They learn to break negative thinking patterns, overcome
social emotional problems and seek help when they need to. Students are
also taught to stand up against stigma around mental health issues.</p>
