<p><b>Physical and Mental Health</b></p>
<p><b>Approach</b></p>
In Peicai, we aim to develop in our students a holistic approach to supporting their well-being, covering physical health, social and emotional development and psychological support when necessary.<br>
<p><b>Curriculum</b></p>
<ul><li> 
We strengthen studentsâ€™ mental health through lessons on Character and Citizenship, Form Teacher Time and Physical Education. </li>
<li>We build character in students through experiential learning platforms such as Co-Curricular Activities, Values-in-Action programme and outdoor education.
</li><li>We teach students social and emotional competencies such as relationship management, stress management and help-seeking skills, which are then put into practice when students engage in various school activities.</li></ul>
