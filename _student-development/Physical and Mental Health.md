<p><strong>Physical and Mental Health</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>In Peicai, we aim to develop in our students a holistic approach to supporting
their well-being, covering physical health, social and emotional development
and psychological support when necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We strengthen students’ mental health through lessons on Character and
Citizenship, Form Teacher Time and Physical Education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We build character in students through experiential learning platforms
such as Co-Curricular Activities, Values-in-Action programme and outdoor
education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We teach students social and emotional competencies such as relationship
management, stress management and help-seeking skills, which are then put
into practice when students engage in various school activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers monitor the well-being of students and work closely with parents
and school counsellors to render additional support to those who need it.
Schools also work with partners such as the Ministry of Social and Family
Development (MSF), mental health professionals and Family Service Centres
to support students and their families within the community.</p>
<p><strong>Character and Citizenship Education 2021</strong>
</p>
<p>The refreshed Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum has
been progressively implemented in schools since 2021.
<br>
<br>Mental Health Education is one of the key features of the CCE curriculum.
Through these lessons, students are equipped with knowledge and skills
to build their resilience, strengthen their mental well-being and resolve
their challenges.
<br>
<br>For example, students learn to differentiate normal stress from distress
and mental illness. They learn to break negative thinking patterns, overcome
social emotional problems and seek help when they need to. Students are
also taught to stand up against stigma around mental health issues.</p>
