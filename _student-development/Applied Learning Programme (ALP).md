<p>Peicai&rsquo;s Applied Learning Programme focuses on Applied Food Science over the course of a one-year long programme, from Secondary 1 Semester 2 to Secondary 2 Semester 1. Through this programme, we aim to put students through various soft and hard skills modules, in addition to the content taught throughout the year.</p>
<p>Skills taught include:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Students go through a series of theoretical and practical sessions, both in the Science laboratories as well as the Food and Consumer Education (FCE) kitchens. At the end of the one year long programme, students whip up a healthy and professional meal for the elders from Lions Befrienders through a yearly affair called Project HEART, a specially planned programme for our Secondary 2 students.</p>
<p>Students who wish to explore further into the area of Applied Food Science can also participate in our Tier 2 programmes, where they will be given the chance to learn more and deeper through our appointed industrial partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope that this programme will give our students a perspective into geriatrics &ndash; the evaluation and management of unique healthcare needs of older people, as the need for more Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) expertise grows in Singapore.</p>
