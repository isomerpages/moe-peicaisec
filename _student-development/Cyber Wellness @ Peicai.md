<p><strong>Curriculum:</strong>
</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness education is conducted through CCE lessons, key Student
Development Experiences (SDEs) beyond the classroom, school-based initiatives,
teachable moments during subject lessons, and learning opportunites beyond
school. It involves understanding what responsible behaviour entails when
a student is exploring cyberspace as well as the knowledge, skills, values,
and attitudes one should possess in order to protect oneself online.</p>
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness Framework – Sense, Think and Act</strong>
</p>
<p>The school adopts MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework, which focuses on three
key processes:&nbsp;<em>Sense, Think</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Act</em>.</p>

</div>
<p>Authentic case studies and real-world examples are integrated into lessons
for students to ‘Sense’ &amp; ‘Think’, providing opportunities to reflect
on how Cyber Wellness relates to their daily routines.</p>
<p>Platforms such as Values-in-action Projects and opportunities to take
part in community projects provide our students with the ability to take
on the role as advocates to share the messages of Cyber Wellness with their
peers, family and public.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>National Cyber Wellness Competition</strong>
</p>
<p>Organised by Pasir Ris Secondary School and the Media Literacy Council
in support of the "Digital for Life" initiative, this year's competition
focused on three pivotal areas: Discerning Fake News; Cultivating Safe
Gaming Habits; Ensuring Social Media Safety</p>
<p>Our students submitted a total of six entries - five group and one individual
poster for the competition, a culmination of their research, creative expression,
and understanding of crucial cyber wellness themes like digital safety
and cyber ethics. This experience was an excellent platform for developing
key 21st Century Competencies. For instance, students honed their Communication,
Collaboration, and Information Skills as they worked in teams to evaluate
online sources and convey their findings visually. The process also sharpened
their Critical and Inventive Thinking, requiring them to analyze complex
issues like fake news and generate creative solutions. Ultimately, it fostered
a strong sense of Civic Literacy by deepening their understanding of their
roles as responsible digital citizens.</p>

<p><strong>Singapore Schools Cyberwellness Challenge (SSCWC)</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are incredibly proud to celebrate the participation of our student
mentors, Grace Mercy Tomy (3C3) and Pratheepan Poorni (3C4), in the recent
Singapore Schools Cyber Wellness Challenge (SSCWC). This national short
film competition, supported by the Media Literacy Council, is designed
to promote youth advocacy and cultivate student leadership in Cyber Wellness
education.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The challenge features a unique collaborative structure where each team
comprises primary school participants led by two secondary school mentors.
In this role, Jesmine and Poorni guided a talented team of three students
from Zhangde Primary School, embodying the programme’s goal of integrating
Peer Support and Relationships into digital literacy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Under the 2024 theme "Be Safe, Be Kind, Be Smart," the team first explored
critical Cyber Wellness issues and applied their insights to storyboard
and develop a film concept and finally producing their short film using
the applets and video-editing software.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This immersive experience empowers students to create meaningful media
that can educate their peers and the wider community. Congratulations to
Grace and Poorni on their outstanding commitment and leadership!</p>

<p><strong>Be Cybersafe - Cybersecurity Sharing by Cybersecurity Agency of Singapore (CSA)</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this assembly talk on Cyber Citizenship, students learned how being
digitally alert and responsible online is crucial in protecting themselves
and others from risks posed by hackers, scammers, and online predators.
They explored how malware and phishing attacks can easily compromise personal
devices and information. Emphasizing the need to stay one step ahead of
ill-doers, the session covered recognizing phishing attempts, enabling
2-Factor Authentication (2FA), and using strong passphrases. Real-life
demonstrations reinforced the importance of safeguarding our digital spaces
from malicious intent.</p>
