<p><strong>Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness education is conducted through CCE lessons, key Student
Development Experiences (SDEs) beyond the classroom, school-based initiatives,
teachable moments during subject lessons, and learning opportunites beyond
school. It involves understanding what responsible behaviour entails when
a student is exploring cyberspace as well as the knowledge, skills, values,
and attitudes one should possess in order to protect oneself online.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness Framework – Sense, Think and Act</strong>
</p>
<p>The school adopts MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework, which focuses on three
key processes:&nbsp;<em>Sense, Think</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Act</em>.</p>

</div>
<p>Authentic case studies and real-world examples are integrated into lessons
for students to ‘Sense’ &amp; ‘Think’, providing opportunities to reflect
on how Cyber Wellness relates to their daily routines.</p>
<p>Platforms such as Values-in-action Projects and opportunities to take
part in community projects provide our students with the ability to take
on the role as advocates to share the messages of Cyber Wellness with their
peers, family and public.</p>

<h4><strong>Key Programmes:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Be Cybersafe - Cybersecurity Sharing by Cybersecurity Agency of Singapore (CSA)</strong>
</p>
<p>In this assembly talk on Cyber Citizenship, students learned how being
digitally alert and responsible online is crucial in protecting themselves
and others from risks posed by hackers, scammers, and online predators.
They explored how malware and phishing attacks can easily compromise personal
devices and information. Emphasizing the need to stay one step ahead of
ill-doers, the session covered recognizing phishing attempts, enabling
2-Factor Authentication (2FA), and using strong passphrases. Real-life
demonstrations reinforced the importance of safeguarding our digital spaces
from malicious intent.</p>
