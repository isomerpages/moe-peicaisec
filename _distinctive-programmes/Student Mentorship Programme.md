<h4><strong>Peicai-Zhonghua ALP Mentorship Programme</strong></h4>
<p>A select group of 28 Secondary 2 students from Peicai Secondary School
teamed up with Primary 6 pupils from Zhonghua Primary School in the Peicai–Zhonghua
ALP Mentorship Programme. The interschool partnership empowers our students
to take on mentorship roles, guiding their younger peers in using digital
tools to address real-world challenges.</p>
<p>For this year’s partnership, our Secondary 2 mentors worked with their
mentees on the theme of Sustainable Living. They explored proposed future
laws that aim to make Singapore a cleaner and more sustainable nation.
With the aid of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tool, students
were tasked to prepare and present their stance on whether the laws should
be implemented.</p>
<p>Through the programme, Peicians strengthened their leadership and mentoring
skills, and develop their creativity and problem-solving abilities. More
importantly, it offers our Tier 2 ALP students a meaningful opportunity
to give back by sharing their expertise and inspiring their juniors.</p>
