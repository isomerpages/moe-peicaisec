<td style="width: 50%;"><p align="justify">Bus Captains are a group of unsung heroes who kept Singapore moving during the pandemic. Despite the dangerous and critical situation caused by the contagious virus, they held firm and continue to fulfill their responsibilities of fetching Singaporeans to work and school. Singapore is able to emerge from the pandemic stronger than before due to their effort, We felt that it is time for Peicains to step up to show our gratitude and thanks to our BUs Captains!

<td style="width: 50%;"><p align="justify">Last Friday. 11 of our student leaders together with Prinicpal Mr Michael, Ms Lim and Mr Koh paid a visit to Serangoon Bus Interchange.
Our Principal Mr Michael presented the crane installation to Mr Bernard Goh , Head of Operations of SBS transit.
Yakun Kaya Toast was very supportive of our effort and sponsored 100 sets of kaya toast and drinks for our Bus Caps. Our gesture of appreciation to the bus caps resonated with Yakun CEO Mr Tanaka. He paid us a surprise visit that day at the interchange (photo bottom right)

As we presented the toast and drinks to the bus captains, we felt heartened that we were able to do our part for the community as students and as part of Peicai Secondary.
That really made us feel very proud!
