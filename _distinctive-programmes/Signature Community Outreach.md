<p>Last Friday. 11 of our student leaders together with Prinicpal Mr Michael,
Ms Lim and Mr Koh paid a visit to Serangoon Bus Interchange. Our Principal
Mr Michael presented the crane installation to Mr Bernard Goh , Head of
Operations of SBS transit. Yakun Kaya Toast was very supportive of our
effort and sponsored 100 sets of kaya toast and drinks for our Bus Caps.
Our gesture of appreciation to the bus caps resonated with Yakun CEO Mr
Tanaka. He paid us a surprise visit that day at the interchange (photo

<p>As we presented the toast and drinks to the bus captains, we felt heartened
that we were able to do our part for the community as students and as part
