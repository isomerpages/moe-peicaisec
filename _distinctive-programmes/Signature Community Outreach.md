with various partner organisations to advocate for their chosen stakeholders.
Working closely with these organisations, students developed and executed

in school, where they advocated for their stakeholders and beneficiaries,
raising awareness and encouraging further involvement from their peers.</p>

<p>Bus Captains are a group of unsung heroes who kept Singapore moving during
the pandemic. Despite the dangerous and critical situation caused by the
contagious virus, they held firm and continue to fulfill their responsibilities
of fetching Singaporeans to work and school. Singapore is able to emerge
from the pandemic stronger than before due to their effort, We felt that
it is time for Peicains to step up to show our gratitude and thanks to
our BUs Captains!</p>

<p>Last Friday. 11 of our student leaders together with Prinicpal Mr Michael,
Ms Lim and Mr Koh paid a visit to Serangoon Bus Interchange. Our Principal
Mr Michael presented the crane installation to Mr Bernard Goh , Head of
Operations of SBS transit. Yakun Kaya Toast was very supportive of our
effort and sponsored 100 sets of kaya toast and drinks for our Bus Caps.
Our gesture of appreciation to the bus caps resonated with Yakun CEO Mr
Tanaka. He paid us a surprise visit that day at the interchange (photo

<p>As we presented the toast and drinks to the bus captains, we felt heartened
that we were able to do our part for the community as students and as part
of Peicai Secondary. That really made us feel very proud!</p>

<p>Working together, our students embarked on an impactful VIA project in
collaboration with CDAC and prepared two lessons to teach primary school
students from CDAC how to hand-make a xylophone and panflute using recycled
materials.
<br>
<br>Throughout this transformative journey, our students honed essential E21CC
skills, including effective communication and collaborative teamwork. Their
unwavering dedication not only enriched the lives of these young children
but also left a lasting, positive impact on the broader community.</p>
