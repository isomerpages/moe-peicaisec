<h4>PinnaCle Challenge by PinnaCle@Peicai</h4>
<p></p><p align="justify">The PinnaCle Challenge, an inaugural competition organised by Peicai Secondary School's Talent Development Programme (PinnaCle@Peicai), took place on 23 October 2023. It brought together approximately 120 Primary 6 pupils from different schools to collaborate, experiment, and compete in the development of innovative and critical solutions or approaches to address global issues.</p>
<p></p><p align="justify">This year's theme for the Challenge was Sustainability. The aim was to elevate consciousness regarding sustainable living and empower our young learners to understand their pivotal role in bolstering sustainability initiatives, thereby contributing to a greener world. By tackling sustainability using knowledge and skills from various domains such as English Language, Mathematics, and Science, Peicai hopes to provide a holistic perspective of sustainable practices.</p>
<p></p><p align="justify">Working in teams of four, the Primary 6 participants, under the mentorship of the PinnaCle Student Mentors, engaged in the challenge tasks within a set timeframe. As the culmination of the process, they then presented their deliverables to a panel of judges. The pupils put up a persuasive showcase to convince the judges of their innovative and viable sustainability actions.</p>
