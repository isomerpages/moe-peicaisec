<p>The Science PinnaCle Programme is designed to nurture and support students
with a strong interest and aptitude in science. This programme provides
enriched learning experiences that go beyond the classroom, allowing students
to engage deeply in scientific exploration and research.</p>
<p>A key highlight of the programme is the collaboration with A*STAR Skin
Research Lab (A*SRL) under the Scientists-in-School (SiS) Programme. Through
this partnership, students participate in various activities such as the
DNA Workshop and Disk Diffusion Workshop, where they learn advanced techniques
like DNA extraction and antibiotic resistance studies. Other workshops
organised by A*SRL also develop important skills like data collection and
analysis.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, students embark on STEM challenges, designed to foster
creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration as students tackle real-world
scientific problems. Students also have the opportunity to go on learning
journeys, which provide them with unique, firsthand experiences in various
scientific fields. Visits include the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum,
the Seed Bank at the Singapore Botanic Garden as well as laboratory visit
to A*SRL.</p>
<p>To further enhance their scientific experience, students have the opportunity
to take part in prestigious science research competitions. These include
the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair Competition, the International
Elementz Fair, and the A*STAR-VJC Science Fair. Through these platforms,
students can present their research projects, compete with peers from other
schools, and gain recognition at both cluster and national levels.</p>
<p>The Science PinnaCle Programme offers a dynamic and inspiring environment
for students to explore their passion for science, develop critical research
skills, and grow as young scientists ready to contribute to the scientific
community.</p>
