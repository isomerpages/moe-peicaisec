<h4>English PinnaCle Programme</h4>
<p>The English PinnaCle Programme is a talent development initiative that
provides students with rich and diverse opportunities to hone their literary,
linguistic, and critical thinking abilities. Through partnerships with
esteemed organisations such as SingLit Station, students engaged in creative
writing workshops led by celebrated local authors including Neil Humphreys,
Daryl Qilin Yam, and Danny Jalil, providing experiences that sharpened
their expressive flair and inventive thought. Beyond writing, PinnaCle
nurtures articulate and confident speakers through platforms like the Singapore
Secondary School Debating Championships, where students refine their communication,
collaboration, and analytical skills. The programme also broadens students’
civic and cultural perspectives through learning journeys to places such
as Parliament House, where they gain first-hand insights into governance
and current affairs, and local theatre productions like <em>Don’t Know, Don’t Care</em> and <em>Perfecting Pratas</em>,
which deepen their understanding of contemporary social issues. In celebrating
their passion for the English Language, students also participate in national
literary and oratorical competitions such as the Unity Young Writers Festival,
ACJC Orator’s Trophy, YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards, Straits Times
What’s the News Quiz, and the Live On! Essay Competition. Collectively,
these experiences empower students to think critically, communicate persuasively,
and engage meaningfully with the world around them.</p>
