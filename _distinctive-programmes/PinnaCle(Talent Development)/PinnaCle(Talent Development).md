<h4>PinnaCle Challenge by PinnaCle@Peicai</h4>
<p>The PinnaCle Challenge, an annual competition hosted by the educators
and students of Peicai Secondary School's Talent Development Programme
(PinnaCle@Peicai), serves as a platform for Primary 6 pupils from different
schools to collaborate, experiment, and compete, thereby fostering the
development of innovative and critical solutions or approaches to address
real world problems.</p>
<p>This is our third year holding the challenge after a successful run last
year, which saw 16 teams of Primary Six pupils engaged in a spirited journey
of discovery and learning, tackling hands-on English, Math &amp; Science,
and Sports challenges, while our PinnaCle student mentors grew in confidence
and teamwork as they mentored and guided their younger peers. The event
captured the spirit of curiosity and purposeful learning that defines the
PinnaCle Programme.</p>
<p>In line with MOE’s enhanced 21CC Framework and EdTech Masterplan 2030,
the objectives of the PinnaCle Challenge are:</p>
<p>(a) To enhance pupils’ inventive thinking, communication, and problem-solving
skills; and</p>
<p>(b) To develop pupils’ digital literacy and technological skills.</p>
<p>This competition provides your Primary Six pupils with a platform to learn
from their peers across schools, refine their ideas, and actively engage
in solving contemporary challenges from four subject disciplines: English,
Mathematics, Science, and Sports. Additionally, the event will expose your
students to using technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Augmented Reality (AR).</p>
<p>Working in teams of four, the Primary 6 participants, under the mentorship
of the PinnaCle Student Mentors, engaged in the challenge tasks within
a set timeframe. As the culmination of the process, they then presented
their deliverables to a panel of judges. The pupils put up a persuasive
showcase to convince the judges of their innovative and viable solutions.</p>
