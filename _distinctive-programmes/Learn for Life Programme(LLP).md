<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Learn for Life Programme aims to cultivate leadership qualities in
our students by fostering personal mastery and socio-emotional competencies.
We strive to empower students to make meaningful contributions to society,
becoming responsible and compassionate individuals who lead by serving
others.</p>
<p>Through this approach, we encourage the following in our Peicaians:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Personal Growth: Students cultivate self-awareness, resilience, and discipline,
which are key traits of personal mastery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Socio-Emotional Learning (SEL): Students build empathy, relationship management,
responsible decision-making, and teamwork, which are crucial for fostering
a community-oriented mindset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community Engagement: By participating in community projects, students
learn to lead by example and contribute to causes that benefit others,
reinforcing the values of responsibility, service, and empathy.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Leadership Through and For the Community programme is designed to
nurture future-ready leaders who exemplify strong values and a commitment
to personal growth. Through various experiential learning opportunities,
students develop key leadership skills, such as resilience, empathy, and
collaboration, while engaging in projects that make a positive impact on
the community.</p>
<p>By encouraging students to demonstrate these values in real-world settings,
we aim to cultivate a sense of responsibility and social awareness, shaping
them into leaders who not only excel in their personal lives but also inspire
and uplift others around them.</p>

needs and challenges related to their selected cause. Through workshops,
discussions, and guided research, students explore how these social causes
affect their community and the world at large.</p>

<p><strong><u>Secondary 2: Acting on Social Causes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In Secondary 2, students transition from learning to taking action. Using
the knowledge and insights gained in Secondary 1, they collaborate with
their classmates to design and implement small-scale projects that address
the social cause they have chosen. These initiatives may take place within
the school or extend into the wider community, offering students the chance
to make a direct impact.</p>
<p><strong>Key Objectives for Secondary 2:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Take meaningful action through projects that address social causes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborate with peers to create impact, either in school or the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving skills in real-world
settings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This hands-on approach empowers students to apply leadership, teamwork,
and problem-solving skills, ensuring they learn the value of action in
creating positive change. The focus at this level is on turning awareness
into tangible contributions.</p>
