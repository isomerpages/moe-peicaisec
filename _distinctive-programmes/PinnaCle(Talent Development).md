<h4>PinnaCle Challenge by PinnaCle@Peicai</h4>
<p></p>
<p>The PinnaCle Challenge, an inaugural competition organised by Peicai Secondary
School's Talent Development Programme (PinnaCle@Peicai), took place on
23 October 2023. It brought together approximately 120 Primary 6 pupils
from different schools to collaborate, experiment, and compete in the development
of innovative and critical solutions or approaches to address global issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year's theme for the Challenge was Sustainability. The aim was to
elevate consciousness regarding sustainable living and empower our young
learners to understand their pivotal role in bolstering sustainability
initiatives, thereby contributing to a greener world. By tackling sustainability
using knowledge and skills from various domains such as English Language,
Mathematics, and Science, Peicai hopes to provide a holistic perspective
of sustainable practices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Working in teams of four, the Primary 6 participants, under the mentorship
of the PinnaCle Student Mentors, engaged in the challenge tasks within
a set timeframe. As the culmination of the process, they then presented
their deliverables to a panel of judges. The pupils put up a persuasive
showcase to convince the judges of their innovative and viable sustainability
actions.</p>
