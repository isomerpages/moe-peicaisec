<h4><strong>Peicai Secondary School Shines at Design Education Summit 2023</strong></h4>
<p></p><p align="justify">In an outstanding display of innovation and design thinking, Peicai Secondary School’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) team was spotlighted at the Selected from 20 projects teams under the DSg Council’s ‘Design Thinking in Schools’ Project, our team presented their collaborative journey with the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) - a journey that captured the imagination of the education and design community.</p>
<p align="justify">The Summit, graced by Minister Chan as the Guest-of-Honour, centered on three key questions: Is Design for Everyone? Will Human Creativity Survive AI? Too Young to Make a Difference? Minister Chan set an inspiring tone, affirming that “every age can design, everyone can design, and every idea counts”.</p>
<p align="justify">Peicai Secondary’s presentation echoed this ethos. Our student, Jervin Yeo Kai Jie from Class 1-Innovation, showcased a remarkable Smart Toilet Paper Dispenser prototype. His group project exemplifies our school's commitment to transforming the ALP curriculum from 'Health and Food Science' to a more interdisciplinary theme focusing on social causes, design thinking, and innovation.</p>
<p align="justify">The response to our presentation was overwhelmingly positive. Not only did it receive accolades from other distinguished speakers who made reference to it in their addresses, but it also stood out as the only school presentation that included a student’s perspective. This approach resonated strongly with the audience, highlighting Peicai Secondary’s dedication to involving students as co-creators in our ALP redesign journey.</p>
<p align="justify">Our participation in the Summit was not just a moment of pride for Peicai Secondary; it was a testament to our vision of nurturing future-ready innovators and problem-solvers. The school is committed to.</p>
