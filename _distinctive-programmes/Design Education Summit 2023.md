<h4><strong>Peicai Secondary School Shines at Design Education Summit 2023</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>In an outstanding display of innovation and design thinking, Peicai Secondary
School’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) team was selected from 20 projects
teams under the DSg Council’s ‘Design Thinking in Schools’ Project, our
team presented their collaborative journey with the Singapore University
of Technology and Design (SUTD) - a journey that captured the imagination
of the education and design community.</p>
<p>The Summit, graced by Minister Chan as the Guest-of-Honour, centered on
three key questions: Is Design for Everyone? Will Human Creativity Survive
AI? Too Young to Make a Difference? Minister Chan set an inspiring tone,
affirming that “every age can design, everyone can design, and every idea
counts”.</p>
<p>Peicai Secondary’s presentation echoed this ethos. Our student, Jervin
Yeo Kai Jie from Class 1-Innovation, showcased a remarkable Smart Toilet
Paper Dispenser prototype. His group project exemplifies our school's commitment
to transforming the ALP curriculum from 'Health and Food Science' to a
more interdisciplinary theme focusing on social causes, design thinking,
and innovation.</p>
<p>The response to our presentation was overwhelmingly positive. Not only
did it receive accolades from other distinguished speakers who made reference
to it in their addresses, but it also stood out as the only school presentation
that included a student’s perspective. This approach resonated strongly
with the audience, highlighting Peicai Secondary’s dedication to involving
students as co-creators in our ALP redesign journey.</p>
<p>Our participation in the Summit was not just a moment of pride for Peicai
Secondary; it was a testament to our vision of nurturing future-ready innovators
and problem-solvers. The school is committed to continuing this journey,
empowering our students to make a meaningful impact through design and
creativity.</p>
