<p><strong>Work Attachment Opportunities@Peicai</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>In Peicai Secondary School (PCSS), we continue to place a premium on the
holistic development of our students where both academic excellence and
character development are pillars of a holistic education. When students
have an interest and find enjoyment in what they do, they will excel and
be motivated to pursue their interests well beyond school.
<br>
<br>The holistic educational experience as well as opportunities we aim to
provide in PCSS whilst catering to students’ strengths, passion and interests,
strive to nurture our students to be not just equipped with knowledge and
skills but also values and attitudes to navigate the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>To better prepare our students with the right skillsets to navigate the
future, the school seek to partner our industries to provide authentic
work attachments for our students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Through the work attachments, we endeavour for our students to pick-up
real-world skills. Besides that, students who had the opportunity to be
attached to the companies based on their choice and aspirations would potentially
be motivated to strive hard for their academics in order to reach their
goals. This would open up the conversation for them to start to build their
portfolio in applying for JC DSA and Polytechnics PFP.</p>

<p><strong>Mentors :Mr Josephus Tan ( Founder), Mr Josiah Zee , Mr Russell.</strong>
<br>Students enjoyed the novel experience of visiting the court with Mr Josiah
and Mr Russell, and sitting in the consultations. Most of the things they
did during the week-long attachment were new things that they enjoyed exploring.
They found Mr Josephus Tan’s sharing to be very authentic and inspiring.
They also appreciated the patience shown to them by their mentors.</p>

<p><strong>Mentors : Ms Hazel, Ms Mabel Ang .</strong>
<br>Students found the visit to PWC’s CBD office to be an eye-opening experience
that provided them with a deeper insight into what an accounting job entails
(e.g., not just accounting but also assurance, risk assessment and management,
etc.). Some developed a higher interest in accounting after the visit.
They appreciated the interactive and engaging format of the visit, which
gave them the opportunity to pose questions and the patience shown by the
speaker in providing clear explanations to their questions. They are thankful
for the warm hospitality shown.</p>

<p><strong>Mentor : Mr Raymond</strong>
<br>Students found the brainstorming segment to be challenging yet engaging
as they were able to challenge themselves to come up with creative solutions.
They found their newly-gained creative problem-solving skills to be useful
and applicable in their lives. They are also appreciative of the fact that
the various teams at Tribal DBB took time out of their busy schedule to
accommodate our students’ visit to their office.</p>
