<br><strong><u>Visitors to School</u></strong> 
<br>
</p>
<p>All visitors will need to report to the security guard post for registration
upon entering the school gates.</p>
<p>Visitors have to wear their identification tags at all times while in
the school compound.</p>
<p>As parking spaces in the school are very limited, visitors/parents/guardians
who are driving to school are requested to park your vehicles at the HDB
carparks (for Blocks 218 - 222, Serangoon Avenue 4) which is about 1 minute
walk from the school.</p>
