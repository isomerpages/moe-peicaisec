<p>One of the most memorable highlights was a heartfelt performance by the
Parent Support Group (PSG). They presented an original song, “You Show
Up,” which they had specially written and composed in honour of our teachers.
The song’s title is a perfect reflection of what teachers do everyday –
showing up with patience, care, and wisdom, rain or shine. Its meaningful
lyrics deeply moved everyone in the hall, leaving our teachers feeling
truly appreciated.</p>

<p>More than just a celebration, Teachers’ Day Celebration 2025 was a reminder
of the magic our teachers bring into our lives every day. To all our teachers,
thank you for being our Wizards of Wisdom!</p>
<h4><strong>National Day 2025</strong></h4>
<p>The school commemorated National Day to mark the 60th anniversary of our
independence, a significant milestone in Singapore’s history. It was a
time to reflect on our nation’s journey and move onward together in building
our shared future as one united people.</p>
<p>This year, as Singapore turned 60, the school came together for our annual
National Day Parade, which featured a march past by students from NCC,
NPCC and Girl Guides. The celebration reaffirmed the values of multiculturalism,
boldness, resilience, and openness that have united us and enabled Singapore
to thrive over the past six decades.</p>
<p>We were also honoured to have Dr Edmond Tan, Vice-Chairperson of our School
Advisory Committee, grace the occasion as our Guest-of-Honour.</p>
<p>We were also delighted to welcome our seniors from the Lions Befrienders,
who joined us for a day of celebration and joy, with breakfast kindly sponsored
by Ya Kun Kaya Toast.</p>
<p>In the second half of the programme, Peicaians presented a series of celebratory
performances. A standout moment was the spectacular flag fly-past by our
Aeromodelling students, which thrilled the audience. The concert segment
also featured crowd favourites, including the annual Peicai’s Got Talent,
alongside vibrant Band and Modern Dance performances. Adding a fun and
educational twist to the celebration, we hosted 'How Well Do You Know Singapore’s
History? Let’s Play the Singapore Quiz, Peicai Style!' Six staff members
each paired up with a student to tackle questions about Singapore's rich
heritage, sparking curiosity, laughter, and plenty of friendly competition.</p>
<p>The celebration culminated with the school coming together as one heartbeat
in community singing of our favourite National Day songs. It was heartwarming
to see Peicaians enjoying the festivities and embracing the true spirit
of togetherness.</p>
<p>This celebration was a tribute to our shared history and values, reinforcing
our collective commitment to Singapore’s continued progress in the years
ahead.</p>
<p>Majulah Singapura!</p>

<h4><strong>Racial Harmony Day 2025</strong></h4>
<p>Racial Harmony Day was commemorated in school in Week 4 of Term 3 from
the 21<sup>st</sup> July (Monday) to 25<sup>th</sup> July (Friday).</p>
<p>The theme for Racial Harmony Day (RHD) , ‘Our People, Our Tapestry’, reminds
us that the diverse cultural threads in our society are intricately intertwined,
working together to form a vibrant and unified whole. The objective of
RHD is to help students recognise the importance of mutual understanding,
appreciation, and respect among our various ethnic communities; all of
which are key to preserving the strength and harmony of our multicultural
society.</p>
<p>This year, our RHD commemoration continued to deepen students’ awareness
that cultural expression takes many forms. In keeping with the theme, the
focus remained on ethnic food and snacks; always a crowd favourite and
with an exciting new addition: ethnic games.</p>
<p>It was heartening to see our students and teachers coming together during
CCE lessons to bring, share and enjoy a wide array of traditional snacks
and games. The classroom celebrations were filled with laughter, curiosity,
and rich conversations. The lively demonstrations of Kabaddi, Wushu, and
Sepak Raga further engaged our students, sparking interest in traditional
ethnic sports and highlighting the diversity of expression across cultures.</p>
<p>During recess, the interactive ethnic games booth was a popular attraction,
where students enthusiastically participated in nostalgic games such as
5 Stones, Chapteh, and Congkak. Their enthusiasm and openness to explore
reflected the heart of Racial Harmony Day: a celebration of shared experiences
and cultural learning.</p>
<p>The commemoration would not have been possible without the dedication
of our teachers and the wholehearted participation of our students. Together,
they helped bring the theme “Our People, Our Tapestry” to life in meaningful
and memorable ways.</p>

<h4><strong>Mid-Year SWAP for Secondary 3 students</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Work Attachment Opportunities@Peicai</strong>
</p>
<p>In Peicai Secondary School (PCSS), we continue to place a premium on the
holistic development of our students where both academic excellence and
character development are pillars of a holistic education. When students
have an interest and find enjoyment in what they do, they will excel and
be motivated to pursue their interests well beyond school.</p>
<p>The holistic educational experience as well as opportunities we aim to
provide in PCSS whilst catering to students’ strengths, passion and interests,
strive to nurture our students to be not just equipped with knowledge and
skills but also values and attitudes to navigate the future.</p>
<p>To better prepare our students with the right skillsets to navigate the
future, the school seek to partner our industries to provide authentic
work attachments for our students.</p>
<p>Through the work attachments, we endeavour for our students to pick-up
real-world skills. Besides that, students who had the opportunity to be
attached to the companies based on their choice and aspirations would potentially
be motivated to strive hard for their academics in order to reach their
goals. This would open up the conversation for them to start to build their
portfolio in applying for JC DSA and Polytechnics PFP.</p>
<p><strong>SWAP@Peicai: A Glimpse into the Working World</strong>
</p>
<p>From 3 to 5 June 2025, selected Secondary 3 students took part in our
school’s distinctive programme, SWAP@Peicai. This initiative provided students
with a unique opportunity to step outside the classroom and experience
a short job attachment with various external organisations.</p>
<p>Students were attached to reputable organisations such as Gain City, the
National Library Board (NLB), Yishun Health, Blood Bank@Punggol and A*STAR.
Through these placements, they observed the day-to-day operations across
different industries — from retail and public service to healthcare and
scientific research. These experiences gave them a deeper understanding
of the working world and helped them appreciate the skills and values needed
in different professional environments.</p>
<p>SWAP@Peicai continues to be a meaningful and eye-opening experience, encouraging
students to explore potential career interests and reflect on their aspirations
for the future.</p>

<h4><strong>Celebration &amp; Recognition Day, Semester 1 2025</strong></h4>
<p>On 30 May 2025, the last day of Semester 1, the school came together to
celebrate our bi-annual Celebration &amp; Recognition Day. This was a day
where students from various levels were commended for their academic and
non-academic achievements.</p>
<p>In the area of academic achievements, 2 different awards were given out:
the All-Round Excellence Award as well as the Principal’s List Award. Alumni
Class of 2024 were invited back to Peicai where the school recognized and
celebrated their performance in the GCE N and O level examinations and
their holistic achievements in the school. The Outstanding Student of the

<p>Additionally, the Principal’s List, the most prestigious academic award
in the school, was also awarded to students from the Secondary 1 to 5 levels.
It was introduced in 2022 to both recognize and commend students for their
outstanding academic performance in the examinations. Award recipients
would have had to demonstrate exemplary conduct to be an awardee of the
Principal’s List. In addition to motivating the students, it is the school’s
hope that the students on the Principal’s List would also be an inspiration
to the student body that nothing is impossible with discipline and hardwork.</p>

<h4><strong>G2G Brunei School Exchange Programme 2025 – A Celebration of Cultural and Educational Bonds</strong></h4>
<p>23 May 2025 marked the conclusion of the G2G Brunei School Exchange Programme,
a five-day immersive experience (from 19 – 23 May 2025) that brought together
students and educators from Brunei and Singapore. Our Vice-Principal, Ms
Chung, along with Ms Jacelyn and Mr Kelvin Leong, bid a warm farewell to
the Bruneian delegation after a week of shared learning, friendship, and
meaningful cultural exchange.</p>
<p>Throughout the programme, Bruneian students spent most of their time in
our school with their Peicai buddies — our very own G2G Brunei Student
Ambassadors — engaging in a range of academic and co-curricular activities.
These interactions offered a unique window into school life in Singapore
and fostered genuine cross-cultural friendships.</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom, the delegation explored Singapore’s rich multicultural
heritage through visits to iconic cultural sites such as <strong>Kampong Glam</strong>, <strong>Chinatown</strong>,
and <strong>Gardens by the Bay</strong>. These excursions deepened their
understanding of Singapore’s diversity and allowed for experiential learning
in an urban, multicultural context.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, educators from both countries engaged in insightful conversations
on educational practices, exchanging ideas on pedagogy, curriculum innovation,
and student development. It was a valuable platform for professional exchange
and future collaboration.</p>
<p>This programme’s success was made possible thanks to the contributions
of many dedicated individuals. We would like to express our heartfelt appreciation
to all the teachers, school staff and students who contributed to the success
of this programme.</p>

<h4><strong>Hari Raya Celebrations 2025</strong></h4>
<p>On 16 April 2025, the Peicai school hall came alive with vibrant energy
as students gathered for a memorable Hari Raya Concert, organised by the
Malay Language Unit. This year’s celebration was extra special, with cultural
arts group <em>Wira Budaya</em> invited to share insights on how Hari Raya
is celebrated across Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore.</p>
<p>The first segment opened with a captivating Malay Dance performance, showcasing
the grace and elegance of traditional movements. <em>Wira Budaya</em> then
took the stage to highlight the differences in festive customs across the
three countries. Students and teachers alike were fully engaged as they
took part in interactive quizzes. Excitement reached new heights during
the lively Malay Dance Challenge, where everyone was invited to stand up
and dance along.</p>
<p>Following a heartfelt farewell to <em>Wira Budaya</em>, the spotlight turned
to our very own Peicaians in the second segment. Our Secondary 2 boys,
Ayden (2IN) and Sufi (2CE), delivered a powerful Silat performance, reminding
us that Silat is not only a martial art, but also a cultural treasure steeped
in tradition and discipline.</p>
<p>Next, the audience was treated to a joyful rendition of <em>‘Hari Raya’</em> by
Nurleen (4C2) and Ashley (3CY), lifting spirits and prompting smiles throughout
the hall. This was followed by a lively Malay Dance performance by our
talented Secondary 3 and 4 girls.</p>
<p>The concert culminated in a delightful finale, where Malay teachers from
various departments joined students on stage, wrapping up the celebration
with unity and cheer. It was a truly enriching day—one filled with culture,
connection, and celebration for both staff and students.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Council Presidential Elections 2025</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>17th Student Council Presidential Rally 2025: Leadership in Action</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The annual Student Council Presidential Rally, masterfully orchestrated
by the 16th Executive Committee, showcased student leadership at its finest
as five exceptional candidates presented their vision for the school's
future. Held in the school multi-purpose hall, the event drew an impressive
turnout of students, teachers, and staff members, all eager to hear from
their potential student president.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the rally was to provide a platform for presidential
candidates to articulate their manifestos and electoral symbols as seen
in Fig. 1 and connect directly with the student body. This democratic process,
entirely student-led, demonstrated the remarkable capability of Peicai's
student leaders in organising and managing significant school events.</p>

and student agency in action.</p>
<p>The five candidates, each bringing unique perspectives and leadership
styles, took turns addressing the audience. Their presentations demonstrated
thorough preparation and genuine passion for serving the student body.
What set this year's rally apart was the innovative use of Instagram's
Q&amp;A function as seen in Fig. 2, which allowed both students and members
of the public to submit their questions before the rally. This digital
integration, onceptualized and implemented by the student leaders, made
the event more interactive and accessible than ever before.</p>

student body. The seamless execution of the rally demonstrated how student-led
initiatives can create meaningful and impactful experiences for the school
community.</p>

leadership in Peicai Secondary School.</p>

<h4><strong>Peicai inter-class Debate Championship 2025</strong></h4>
<p>The Inter-Class Debating Championship is an annual tournament helmed by
the English Department. It serves as an exciting and engaging platform
for students to hone their public speaking, critical thinking, communication
and collaboration skills.</p>
<p>Each Secondary 3 class will send a team of five students to compete against
one another in the various debating rounds (preliminary, semi-final and
the Grand Final round). Teams will be assigned a motion to debate on and
assigned either the side of proposition or opposition. The debaters will
proceed to develop their main arguments and prepare their speeches, supported
by evidence and statistics that they have selected during the research
phase. The Grand Final of the Inter-Class Debating Championship was held
during the assembly programme in front of the entire school, and adjudicated
by Mr Keith Teo, Ms Daphne Lim, and Mr Mark Gabriel from the Julia Gabriel
Centre. Mr Mark Gabriel shared his overall feedback for the debate round
and offered insights on both the public speaking and persuasive skills
for the debaters as well as the content and structure of each speech.</p>
<p>The Peicai inter-class Debate Championship 2025 has successfully concluded,
and English Language Department would like to extend our appreciation to
everyone for supporting the event to give the debaters an opportunity to
hone their critical thinking skills as well as develop effective communication
skills.</p>

<p>On 4 April 2025, the graduating cohort of Secondary 4 and 5 students gathered
for a meaningful and heartfelt CCA Appreciation and Stand Down Ceremony,
marking the end of a significant chapter in their school journey. With
the theme ‘Adieu’, the event symbolised a fond farewell - celebrating the
achievements, friendships, and memories forged over the past four to five
years.</p>
<p>The ceremony began on a high note with a surprise video montage, lovingly
curated and orchestrated by our very own CCA leaders. The video was a nostalgic
walk down memory lane, capturing the spirit, laughter, and hard work behind
each CCA’s journey.</p>
<p>A flag walk-in ceremony followed, setting the tone for a dignified and
proud moment for all. One of the most solemn highlights was the Uniformed
Groups Passing Out Parade, presided over by our Vice Principal, Ms Chung.
This final salute was a stirring tribute to the dedication and discipline
of our UG cadets.</p>
<p>Selected CCA leaders also took to the stage to lead the cohort in reciting
the CCA Aspiration Statement, as well as to share heartfelt speeches -
a blend of gratitude, reflection, and encouragement for their juniors to
carry the torch forward. Their words resonated deeply with the audience,
reflecting the passion and leadership they’ve shown over the years.</p>
<p>The celebration concluded with a buffet treat and individual CCA farewell
sessions, where juniors and teachers expressed their appreciation in warm
and creative ways - from heartfelt gifts to fun games and meaningful activities.</p>
<p>We extend our deepest thanks to the graduating cohort for their unwavering
contributions, resilience, and commitment to their CCAs. Your legacy will
inspire generations to come. We wish you all the best for your upcoming
National Examinations!</p>

<h4><strong>Peicai Sports Day 2025</strong></h4>

Day.</p>
<p>Aimed not just to build the physical fitness and mental resilience of

Day fosters a healthy competitive sporting culture, that serves to strengthen
class and school spirit. With HOD PE CCA Mr Alvin Yeo covering commentary
alongside Student Council EXCO’s Isaac Hoon Mirante, the event looks set
to come alive!</p>

<p>There were quite a few storied rivalries on the track in this year’s edition.
One of these, was the clash amongst best friends; Muhd Ilhami, Kasyful
Fareez and Aiman was one of the must-see competitions in the 200 meters
upper secondary boys event.</p>
<p>Finishing first, second and fourth respectively in 2023, they were hoping
to upstage one another, given this opportunity at the newly-renovated Serangoon
track. Ilhami though, had other ideas, as he blitzed through the curve
in first place, and never looked back, taking down Nikhil Jayden’s 2023
record by 0.17 seconds, touching the finish line at 25.61 seconds, properly
cementing his legacy as the fastest-ever 200m runner in Peicai, holding
both the lower and upper secondary category records.</p>

<p>Another rivalry that continued this year was the challenge of Samantha
Sonya against Lola Jane Wilkinson, also in the 200 meters event. Both student
athletes were neck-and-neck at the 150<sup>th</sup> meter mark, and it was
only in the last 40-50 meters that Lola peeled away to score a win against
her rival, who is 1-year younger than Lola.</p>

<p>The emergence of the parents’ team in the staff-parents race cannot be

Support Group) Team A was holding a commanding lead all the way till the
anchor leg. Alas, they were chased down by hot favourites, the Science
Department, led by HOD Science Mr Edwin Kwek, who managed to cut down the
40-meter deficit to score a win once again.</p>

<p>At the end of the event, our esteemed guest of honour, Vice-President

Mr Mark Chay shared a few words of inspiration to encourage Peicaians to
aspire to be even greater, before giving out many of the prizes to all
award winners. Our Principal, Mr Michael then capped off the wonderful
event by applauding the efforts of the various classes in bringing up class
spirit by cheering on their classmates with poms-poms, support placards
and even banner flags of their classes.</p>
<p>We look forward to the next edition in 2026!</p>

<h4><strong>Breakfast with Principal</strong></h4>
<p>On 22 Feb, Mr Michael hosted close to 50 Sec 1 parents to our "Breakfast
with Principal" event at The Buzz. The parents were treated to a hearty
breakfast of Nasi Lemak, Mee Siam, Carrot cake and for Vegetarian lovers,
fried bee hoon. This was the first event that our PSG Exco partnered our
School in facilitating the discussions. The parents were delighted with
the warm hospitality and the great support shown by the school in supporting
their parenting journey.</p>
<p>School leaders and Key Personnel were invited to engage the parents during
the dialogue session and the Q and A session was so engaging that the session
exceeded the stipulated time by an hour. Notes of affirmation were mentioned
by parents who thanked the FTs and subject teachers for providing consultations
and support for students. On this note, would like to thank all teachers
for your help in helping our Sec 1 students adapt and embrace our School
so quickly.</p>

<h4><strong>Total Defence Day 2025</strong></h4>
<p>As part of our school’s commemoration of Total Defence Day and participation
in Exercise SG Ready 2025, our students participated in the Food Resilience
Preparedness Programme in collaboration with the Singapore Food Agency
(SFA) and SATS on 17 Feb during their CCE lesson.</p>
<p>As part of the experience, each student was given a ready-to-eat (RTE)
meal to consume at ambient temperature with disposable cutleries.</p>
<p>This programme aims to prepare students for uncertainties and potential
food supply disruptions. It encourages them to be adaptable and flexible
in their food choices by being open to accommodate changes and consider
alternative food options in the event of food supply disruptions. It served
as a powerful reminder that we all have a crucial role in keeping Singapore
resilient and united.</p>

fringe activities in the classroom, such as Chinese Calligraphy, where
they could experience the beauty of this traditional art form.</p>
<p>Later, the whole school came together to enjoy a series of performances
