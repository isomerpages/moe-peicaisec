<p>On 4 April 2025, the graduating cohort of Secondary 4 and 5 students gathered
for a meaningful and heartfelt CCA Appreciation and Stand Down Ceremony,
marking the end of a significant chapter in their school journey. With
the theme ‘Adieu’, the event symbolised a fond farewell - celebrating the
achievements, friendships, and memories forged over the past four to five
years.</p>
<p>The ceremony began on a high note with a surprise video montage, lovingly
curated and orchestrated by our very own CCA leaders. The video was a nostalgic
walk down memory lane, capturing the spirit, laughter, and hard work behind
each CCA’s journey.</p>
<p>A flag walk-in ceremony followed, setting the tone for a dignified and
proud moment for all. One of the most solemn highlights was the Uniformed
Groups Passing Out Parade, presided over by our Vice Principal, Ms Chung.
This final salute was a stirring tribute to the dedication and discipline
of our UG cadets.</p>
<p>Selected CCA leaders also took to the stage to lead the cohort in reciting
the CCA Aspiration Statement, as well as to share heartfelt speeches -
a blend of gratitude, reflection, and encouragement for their juniors to
carry the torch forward. Their words resonated deeply with the audience,
reflecting the passion and leadership they’ve shown over the years.</p>
<p>The celebration concluded with a buffet treat and individual CCA farewell
sessions, where juniors and teachers expressed their appreciation in warm
and creative ways - from heartfelt gifts to fun games and meaningful activities.</p>
<p>We extend our deepest thanks to the graduating cohort for their unwavering
contributions, resilience, and commitment to their CCAs. Your legacy will
inspire generations to come. We wish you all the best for your upcoming
National Examinations!</p>

<h4><strong>Peicai Sports Day 2025</strong></h4>
<p>The Secondary 1 The glowing morning sun at Serangoon stadium provided
a sense of vibrance and anticipation to this year’s edition of Peicai Sports
Day.</p>
<p>Aimed not just to build the physical fitness and mental resilience of
our students, the exposure to athletics meant that students’ knowledge
to a range of sporting events both as an actual running participant as
well as an audience member, is widened. On top of it all, Peicai Sports
Day fosters a healthy competitive sporting culture, that serves to strengthen
class and school spirit. With HOD PE CCA Mr Alvin Yeo covering commentary
alongside Student Council EXCO’s Isaac Hoon Mirante, the event looks set
to come alive!</p>

<p>There were quite a few storied rivalries on the track in this year’s edition.
One of these, was the clash amongst best friends; Muhd Ilhami, Kasyful
Fareez and Aiman was one of the must-see competitions in the 200 meters
upper secondary boys event.</p>
<p>Finishing first, second and fourth respectively in 2023, they were hoping
to upstage one another, given this opportunity at the newly-renovated Serangoon
track. Ilhami though, had other ideas, as he blitzed through the curve
in first place, and never looked back, taking down Nikhil Jayden’s 2023
record by 0.17 seconds, touching the finish line at 25.61 seconds, properly
cementing his legacy as the fastest-ever 200m runner in Peicai, holding
both the lower and upper secondary category records.</p>

<p>Another rivalry that continued this year was the challenge of Samantha
Sonya against Lola Jane Wilkinson, also in the 200 meters event. Both student
athletes were neck-and-neck at the 150<sup>th</sup> meter mark, and it was
only in the last 40-50 meters that Lola peeled away to score a win against
her rival, who is 1-year younger than Lola.</p>

<p>The emergence of the parents’ team in the staff-parents race cannot be
underestimated, as both parents’ team started off very well and PSG (Parents
Support Group) Team A was holding a commanding lead all the way till the
anchor leg. Alas, they were chased down by hot favourites, the Science
Department, led by HOD Science Mr Edwin Kwek, who managed to cut down the
40-meter deficit to score a win once again.</p>

<p>At the end of the event, our esteemed guest of honour, Vice-President
of the Singapore National Olympic Council and soon-to-be Secretary General,
Mr Mark Chay shared a few words of inspiration to encourage Peicaians to
aspire to be even greater, before giving out many of the prizes to all
award winners. Our Principal, Mr Michael then capped off the wonderful
event by applauding the efforts of the various classes in bringing up class
spirit by cheering on their classmates with poms-poms, support placards
and even banner flags of their classes.</p>
<p>We look forward to the next edition in 2026!</p>

<h4><strong>Breakfast with Principal</strong></h4>
<p>On 22 Feb, Mr Michael hosted close to 50 Sec 1 parents to our "Breakfast
with Principal" event at The Buzz. The parents were treated to a hearty
breakfast of Nasi Lemak, Mee Siam, Carrot cake and for Vegetarian lovers,
fried bee hoon. This was the first event that our PSG Exco partnered our
School in facilitating the discussions. The parents were delighted with
the warm hospitality and the great support shown by the school in supporting
their parenting journey.</p>
<p>School leaders and Key Personnel were invited to engage the parents during
the dialogue session and the Q and A session was so engaging that the session
exceeded the stipulated time by an hour. Notes of affirmation were mentioned
by parents who thanked the FTs and subject teachers for providing consultations
and support for students. On this note, would like to thank all teachers
for your help in helping our Sec 1 students adapt and embrace our School
so quickly.</p>

<h4><strong>Total Defence Day 2025</strong></h4>
<p>As part of our school’s commemoration of Total Defence Day and participation
in Exercise SG Ready 2025, our students participated in the Food Resilience
Preparedness Programme in collaboration with the Singapore Food Agency
(SFA) and SATS on 17 Feb during their CCE lesson.</p>
<p>As part of the experience, each student was given a ready-to-eat (RTE)
meal to consume at ambient temperature with disposable cutleries.</p>
<p>This programme aims to prepare students for uncertainties and potential
food supply disruptions. It encourages them to be adaptable and flexible
in their food choices by being open to accommodate changes and consider
alternative food options in the event of food supply disruptions. It served
as a powerful reminder that we all have a crucial role in keeping Singapore
resilient and united.</p>

<h4><strong>Chinese New Year 2025</strong></h4>
<p>We celebrated the Lunar New Year on 28 January with a vibrant and festive
atmosphere at school. Peicaians had the opportunity to engage in various
fringe activities in the classroom, such as Chinese Calligraphy, where
they could experience the beauty of this traditional art form.</p>
<p>Later, the whole school came together to enjoy a series of performances
and programs in the school hall, showcasing the rich cultural heritage
of the Lunar New Year. It was a day filled with joy, creativity, and community
spirit as we embraced the traditions and celebrations of this special occasion.</p>
