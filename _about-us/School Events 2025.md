<p>On 22 Feb, Mr Michael hosted close to 50 Sec 1 parents to our "Breakfast
with Principal" event at The Buzz. The parents were treated to a hearty
breakfast of Nasi Lemak, Mee Siam, Carrot cake and for Vegetarian lovers,
fried bee hoon. This was the first event that our PSG Exco partnered our
School in facilitating the discussions. The parents were delighted with
the warm hospitality and the great support shown by the school in supporting
their parenting journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>School leaders and Key Personnel were invited to engage the parents during
the dialogue session and the Q and A session was so engaging that the session
exceeded the stipulated time by an hour. Notes of affirmation were mentioned
by parents who thanked the FTs and subject teachers for providing consultations
and support for students. On this note, would like to thank all teachers
for your help in helping our Sec 1 students adapt and embrace our School
so quickly.</p>
