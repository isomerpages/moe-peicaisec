<p>Welcome to The Cove – Peicai Secondary School’s vibrant student lounge
designed as a safe harbour where students can unwind, interact, and build
lasting friendships. Much like a cove that offers shelter and calm from
the open seas, this inviting space provides students with a warm and welcoming
environment to connect beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Fitted with an exciting range of facilities including a PlayStation 5
with Fifa 25, Nintendo Switch, air hockey, pool table, darts, carrom, and
many more including board games generously sponsored by Principal Mr Michael.</p>
<p>The Cove is the perfect social hub for friendly competition and shared
laughter. Run by our dedicated team of Student Councillors, the lounge
officially opened its doors with great success – Day 1 saw an orderly registration
process managed by the student leaders on duty, and within just 20 minutes,
the lounge hit full capacity.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was buzzing with energy as students immersed themselves
in thrilling rounds of foosball, competitive pool matches, and head-to-head
showdowns on the PS5. The Cove is more than just a games room – it's a
vibrant student-led space where bonds are forged, fun is guaranteed, and
every visit feels like coming home.</p>
