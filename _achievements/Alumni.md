<h4><strong>ONCE A PEICAIAN, ALWAYS A PEICAIAN</strong></h4>
<p>It is always the pride and joy of the school when students who pass through the gates of Peicai look back at their years in the school and remark, &ldquo;Those were the best years of my life.&rdquo; Indeed, for many Peicaians, Peicai is their second home. Here, many have found their sense of belonging, their identity, their best friends, their teacher-mentors, and for a few, their future spouse!</p>

<p><strong>1. Our Very Own Peicai PR<sup>2</sup>IDE Stories</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marcel Lee, Sec 4 Express (2017)<br /></strong>When Marcel first joined&nbsp;Peicai Secondary in Sec 2, he was unmotivated and did not see much meaning behind schooling. However, the caring and supportive environment of teachers and students soon changed him. Marcel was given opportunities to serve and lead in the school and he became a Student Leader and did so well that he was elected into the EXCO. He was also a committed member in the NPCC even though he had only joined the CCA towards the end of Sec 2. These renewed opportunities caused him to grow in his confidence and to aspire to be a role model to his peers and juniors. In Sec 4, Marcel resolved to himself that he would also make both his parents and Peicai proud by doing well in his studies. Although the journey was difficult and he often had many episodes of self-doubt and emotional meltdowns, he persevered till the end. His hard work and resilience in overcoming his challenges were rewarded when he received 6 distinctions in his 2017 O-Level results.</p>
