<h4><strong>Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO) 2025</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>Celebrating Our Mathematics Achievers – SMO &amp; SIMOC 2025</u></strong>
</p>
<p>On 1 August 2025, we celebrated our students’ achievements in the two
prestigious competitions – the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO) and
the Singapore International Math Olympiad Challenge (SIMOC). Our students
have once again demonstrated their talent, perseverance, and passion for
mathematics through their outstanding performance these competitions.</p>
<p>The <strong>Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO)</strong> is one of the
most prestigious mathematics competitions in Singapore, renowned for its
high level of difficulty. It challenges students not only on their mastery
of mathematical concepts, but also on their creativity, logical reasoning,
and problem‑solving skills under time pressure. This year, our Math PinnaCle
students proudly took part in SMO 2025 and achieved remarkable results,
a testament to their dedication and commitment to excellence.</p>
<p>The <strong>Singapore International Math Olympiad Challenge (SIMOC)</strong> is
a global platform that brings together young mathematics enthusiasts from
around the world. It consists of three components: an individual written
Math Olympiad Contest and two team‑based challenges – the Math Master Mind
Competition and the Mind Sports Challenge. Representing our school with
distinction, <strong>Charlotte Voon (1MN)</strong> clinched the <strong>Bronze Award</strong> in
the Math Olympiad Contest and the <strong>Silver Award</strong> in the Math
Master Mind Competition (team challenge).</p>
<p>We are proud of all our students for their remarkable achievements and
commend them for their resilience, passion, and drive to excel in mathematics.</p>
