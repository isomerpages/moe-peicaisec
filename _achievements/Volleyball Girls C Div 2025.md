<p>This year, our C Division Volleyball Girls Team achieved a commendable
milestone by qualifying for the League 3 Finals at the National School
Games (NSG). They have broken a nearly 30 year wait for a medal ever since
we were featured in the North Finals back in 1995.</p>
<p>The National School Games (NSG) is the largest annual inter-school competition
in Singapore, organised by schools for schools. It is a highly anticipated
event in the sporting calendar, offering more than 400 championship titles
to over 60,000 student athletes across primary schools, secondary schools,
junior colleges, and centralised institutions. The NSG not only provides
opportunities for healthy competition, but also cultivates values such
as resilience, teamwork, and sportsmanship.</p>
<p>Throughout the NSG competitions, the girls displayed unwavering grit and
determination, training hard and giving their very best in every match.
In the Finals, they put up an inspiring fight against Queenstown Secondary,
playing with heart and perseverance, before finishing as League 3 Runners-up.</p>
<p>This journey in preparing for the NSG reflects the spirit of commitment
and teamwork, and the school is proud of the girlsâ€™ accomplishment. Thank
you to the school leaders, teachers-in-charge, and the coaches for their
guidance and steadfast support throughout the season, and to the girls
for proudly flying our school flag high.</p>
