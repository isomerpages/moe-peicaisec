<p>The Principal's List, the most prestigious academic award in the school, was introduced in 2022 to both recognise and commend students from the Secondary 1 - 5 levels in the Express, Normal Academic (NA) and Normal Technical (NT) courses for their outstanding academic performance in the Examinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of each semester, students who achieve outstanding results and demonstrate exemplary conduct will be placed on the Principal's List and be awarded a Certificate of Commendation by the school. In addition to motivating the students, it is our hope that the students on the Principal's List would also be an inspiration to the student body that nothing is impossible with discipline and hard work.&nbsp;</p>
