<p>If your child/ward is eligible to take certain subjects at a more demanding
level, you would need to complete Questions 12 and 13 in the <em>Secondary One Registration Form 2025 </em>via
PG or email for those not yet on-board PG <strong>by 23 December 2024 (Mon), 1pm.</strong>
</p>
<p>If the consent is not submitted <strong>by 23 December 2024 (Mon), 1pm</strong>,
the school will take it that you are rejecting the offer to take the subject
at a more demanding level. The school will not be able to accept late submissions
due to deployment and timetabling which need to be done in advance. We
seek your understanding on this.</p>
<p>Once the decision to take a subject at a more demanding level is made
and submitted via PG or email, no request for change will be considered
as it will affect class allocation. We also seek your understanding on
this.</p>
<p>Students are advised not to purchase the textbooks until they have made
a decision whether to accept or reject the SBB offer. Do note that textbooks
must be in acceptable condition for any exchange with the bookshop vendor.</p>
