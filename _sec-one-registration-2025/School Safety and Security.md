<p>Your strong cooperation on safety and security matters is important to our school’s commitment to&nbsp;ensure the safety of your child at all times.</p><p>Students should only alight/be dropped off at the designated venues in the school.</p><p>Like many other driveways, our school's driveway is designed <strong>for passenger pick-up and drop&nbsp;off only</strong>. Any parking along the driveway not designed for that purpose poses a serious safety&nbsp;concern for students and staff. Hence, parking or waiting is not allowed in the school’s driveway.</p><p>All visitors to the school including parents/guardians would need to register with our guard post&nbsp;and put on the visitor’s tag at all times whilst in school for easy identification.</p><p>Please click on the link: <a href="https://www.peicaisec.moe.edu.sg/student-services/school-safety-and-security" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.peicaisec.moe.edu.sg/student-services/school-safety-and-security</a> to find out more about school safety and security.</p>
