<p>Your strong cooperation on safety and security matters is important to
our school’s commitment to ensure the safety of your child at all times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students should only alight/be dropped off at the designated venues in
the school.</p>
<p>Like many other driveways, our school's driveway is designed <strong>for passenger pick-up and drop off only</strong>.
Any parking along the driveway not designed for that purpose poses a serious
safety concern for students and staff. <strong>Hence, parking or waiting is strictly not allowed in the school’s driveway.</strong>
</p>
<p>As parking lots in the school premises are very limited, parents/guardians
who drive to school for appointments or are waiting to pick up their child/ward
can park their cars at the HDB carparks nearby (carparks for Blocks 218
- 222, Serangoon Avenue 4).</p>
<p>All visitors to the school including parents/guardians would need to register
with our guard post and put on the visitor’s tag at all times whilst in
school for easy identification.</p>
