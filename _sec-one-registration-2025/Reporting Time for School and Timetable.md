<p>▪&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><u>Monday – Friday</u> (excluding Wednesday)</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will start assembling in their respective form class at the Parade
square at 7:35 am.</p>
<p>The flag raising ceremony will commence at 7:40am. Students who are not
present with their form class for the flag raising ceremony at the Parade

that matters for the future. Hence, all students are reminded to be punctual
for school.</p>
<p>▪&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><u>Wednesday</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Students will start assembling in their respective form class classrooms

<p>The flag raising ceremony will commence at 8:20am. Students who are not

<p>▪&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><u>Drop off / Alighting Points</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The designated drop-off point is the sheltered front porch and students
will proceed to the Parade square on Mondays, Tuesday, Thursdays and Fridays;
and their respective form class classrooms on Wednesdays for morning assembly.</p>
<p>In the event of rain, students will proceed to the Multi-Purpose Hall
(MPH) for morning assembly on Mondays – Fridays (excluding Wednesday).</p>
<p>Like many other driveways, our school's driveway is designed for passenger
pick-up and drop off only. Any parking along the driveway not designed
for that purpose poses a serious safety concern for students and staff. <strong>Hence, parking or waiting is strictly not allowed in the school’s driveway.</strong>
</p>
<p>We would like to request all drivers/riders to provide your full support
and cooperation to the school’s security guards who perform traffic marshal
duties in the school.</p>
<p>As parking lots in the school premises are very limited, parents/guardians
who drive to school for appointments or are waiting to pick up their child/ward
can park their cars at the HDB carparks nearby (carparks for Blocks 218
- 222, Serangoon Avenue 4).</p>
<p>▪&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><u>Timetable</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Form Teachers would be issuing students their class timetables by 7 January
2025 (Tue).</p>
<p>This timetable will be used with effect from 13 January 2025 (Mon), after
the Secondary One Orientation Week Programme which will be from 06 January
(Mon) to 10 January 2025 (Fri).</p>
