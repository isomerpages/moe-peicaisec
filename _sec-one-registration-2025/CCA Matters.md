<p>CCAs are an integral part of a student’s school life and holistic development.</p>
<p><strong>It is compulsory for all students in secondary school to have at least one CCA.</strong>
</p>
<p>The school will be organising a CCA Open House during the Parent Engagement
Session on 18 January 2025 (Sat) to help students and parents make a well-considered
decision on their choice of CCA.</p>
<p>All Secondary One students would be able to indicate their three preferred
CCA options via an online option form. The link details will be sent via
PG at a later date.</p>

details will be shared during the CCA Open House.</p>
