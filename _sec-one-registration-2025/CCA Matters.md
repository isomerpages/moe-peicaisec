<p>CCAs are an integral part of a student’s school life and holistic development.</p>
<p><strong>It is compulsory for all students in secondary school to have at least one CCA.</strong>
</p>
<p>The school will be organising a CCA Open House during the Parent Engagement
Session on 18 January 2025 (Sat) to help students and parents make a well-considered
decision on their choice of CCA.</p>
<p>All Secondary One students would be able to indicate their three preferred
CCA options via an online option form. The link details will be sent via
PG at a later date.</p>
<p>Please click on the link <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.peicaisec.moe.edu.sg/cca/ccas/</a> for
the list of CCAs offered in the school as well as the CCA schedules. Do
note that in 2025, Debates Society will also be offered as a CCA. More
details will be shared during the CCA Open House.</p>
