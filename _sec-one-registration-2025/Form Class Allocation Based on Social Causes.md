<p>To foster strong class spirit amongst students in a class where they come
from different posting groups, our school assigns students to their form
classes based on the social causes which they are passionate about and
would like to advocate for.</p>
<p>Through school programmes such as the Applied Learning Programme (ALP)
(<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.peicaisec.moe.edu.sg/distinctive-edge/alp-applied-learning-programme/</a> for
Applied Learning Programme) and the Values-In-Action (VIA) programmes,
students in the same form class will be advocating for a common cause for
the betterment of the environment and society.</p>
<p>We <strong><em>strongly encourage</em></strong> you to <strong>discuss</strong>  <strong>the choice of social cause with your child/ward </strong>before
submitting your response. This ensures the choice reflects their genuine
interest, as they will be classed according to their selected cause and
participate in related research and activities in programmes like VIA and
ALP. When students select causes they truly care about, they stay more
engaged and benefit more deeply from the experience.</p>
<p>The list of social causes, as well as the accompanying brief descriptions,
is as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Animal rights and welfare</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Advocating for the well-being of animals (not limited to pets), encompassing
not only their physical needs but also their mental health. Upholding animal
rights and welfare is a fundamental human duty, integral to building a
more inclusive and sustainable society. I envision a world where humans
consistently treat animals with respect, empathy, and understanding, recognising
them as beings deserving of compassionate care.</p>

<p><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Ensuring cyberspace remains a safe and positive environment for all users,
irrespective of age. This commitment is increasingly crucial in our digital
era, where young children are often accessing the online world at an earlier
age and frequently without supervision. Having experienced the impacts
of cyber mischief personally, or through close friends who have been victims,
I am motivated to be an upstander. My aim is to advocate for Cyber Wellness
and contribute meaningfully to making the digital space safer and more
welcoming for everyone.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Environmental Care &amp; Protection</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Fostering environmental sustainability, which necessitates not only conserving
natural resources but also transforming the unethical and unsustainable
practices prevalent in some businesses. This commitment is vital to safeguard
the well-being of both present and future generations. I believe in our
shared duty to care and protect our Earth, recognising the urgency of action
before it becomes irreversibly late.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Gender Equality</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Dismantling gender stereotypes and addressing hidden biases related to
gender. My goal is to confront and challenge the often unspoken assumptions
that unfairly burden both genders, such as the belief that women alone
should be responsible for childcare and family duties. I aim to promote
a broader societal understanding of the equal and shared roles of both
men and women, moving away from perpetuating stereotypes.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Healthcare</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Enhancing the well-being of others by promoting healthy lifestyles and
positive mental health. As we anticipate the challenges of an aging society,
it's crucial that our environment, products, and services adapt accordingly.
I am motivated to address the specific challenges faced by those with conditions
like dementia and diabetes, aiming to alleviate their struggles and improve
their quality of life.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Inclusivity for Special Needs</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Advocating for equity (or fairness) for individuals with special needs,
encompassing both disabilities and neurodiversity (different learning abilities).
My goal is to contribute to building a more inclusive society where every
person is appreciated for their unique strengths, regardless of their initial
circumstances. I am committed to supporting the empowerment of those with
special needs, helping them to achieve independence, safety, and inclusion
in all aspects of life.</p>
