<p>The MAE only applies to students who wish to request for a school transfer
due to&nbsp;<strong><u>serious medical conditions or severe physical impairments</u></strong>.</p>
<p>All appeals must be accompanied by relevant supporting documents such
as an official letter from a certified doctor and/or assessment from qualified
medical professionals.</p>
<p>For students who wish to participate in MAE, parents will need to submit
their appeals at Peicai Secondary School <strong><u>from 8:00 am to 12.00pm on 19 December 2024 (Thu)</u></strong>.</p>
<p>Please come down to the school with the MAE application form (Annex A)
and your medical supporting documents before 12.00pm to allow time for
the processing of the appeal as the MAE exercise will close at 12.00pm.</p>
<p>Appeals are considered by MOE on case-by-case basis. Successful applicants
are typically posted to the nearest school and subject to availabilities
of vacancies. However, parents may select a school from Annex B and provide
the reason for their selection (excludes IS/SAP/AS and schools that are
not participating in 2024 S1 posting). Successful applicants will not be
allowed to reject the reposted school.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The outcome of the MAE application would be made known on 30 December
2024 (tentative).</p>
