<p>The MAE only applies to students who wish to request for a school transfer
due to&nbsp;<strong><u>serious medical conditions or severe physical impairments</u></strong>.</p>
<p>All appeals must be accompanied by relevant supporting documents such
as an official letter from a certified doctor and/or assessment from qualified
medical professionals.</p>
<p>For students who wish to participate in MAE, parents will need to submit
their appeals at Peicai Secondary School <strong><u>from 8:00 am to 12.00pm on 19 December 2024 (Thu)</u></strong>.</p>
<p>Please come down to the school with the MAE application form (Annex A)
and your medical supporting documents before 12.00pm to allow time for
