<p>If your child/ward is eligible to take HMTL based on his/her PSLE results,
you would need to complete Questions 10 &amp; 11 in the <em>Secondary One Registration Form 2025 </em>via
PG or email for those not yet on-board PG <strong>by 23 December 2024 (Mon), 1pm.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>If your child/ward is not eligible to take HMTL based on his/her PSLE
results but meets the school-based eligibility criteria at the end of Semester
One or the Year End Examinations in Semester Two, an offer would be made
by the school for your child/ward to take HMTL.</p>
