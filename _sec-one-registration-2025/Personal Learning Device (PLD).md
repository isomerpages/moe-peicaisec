<p><u>Introduction</u>
</p>
<p>MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) in March 2020
for all schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy.</p>
<p>One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised
Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby
every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning
Device (PLD).</p>
<p><u>PLDs in Teaching and Learning</u>
</p>
<p>Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) have tremendous potential to transform
the learning environment as it enables teachers and students to harness
technology for greater effectiveness in teaching and learning. The use
of the PLDs for teaching and learning will also support the development
of digital literacies in our students as well as develop them as future
ready self-directed and collaborative learners.</p>
<p><u>Choice of PLD in Peicai Secondary School</u>
</p>
<p>The school is using the <strong>Apple iPad 10.2” 9th Gen (64 GB) </strong>as
its choice for the PLD for all students. The device bundle includes a 3-year
warranty, 3-year insurance, a 1st Gen Apple Pencil, and a Logitech keyboard
with cover.</p>

<p>Please note that parents/guardians do not have the option to select a
different PLD or accessory for school purchase. All students are required
to purchase the same device bundle at PCSS, as per MOE guidelines.</p>
