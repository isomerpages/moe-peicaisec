<h4><strong>1. Road Safety Advisory</strong></h4>
<p>We would like to seek your cooperation to work with the school in ensuring
the safety of students coming to and leaving school. This is especially
important as students may not have the skills required to use roads properly
and do not always fully appreciate the dangers presented. Their physique
also makes them less visible to motorists.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Safe driving for motorists</u></em></strong>

<p><strong><em><u>Road Safety for Students</u></em></strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 65%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/sss2.jpg">
</div>
<p>All students are reminded to exercise care and be alert when crossing
roads. They are to abide by all traffic rules to ensure their personal
safety. Students are to&nbsp;<strong>refrain from dashing across the road&nbsp;</strong>without
checking for traffic,&nbsp;<strong>even at traffic crossings&nbsp;</strong>.
We have reminded our students that they need to slow down and check for
traffic as motorists are unable to stop in time if there are sudden movements.
Even at traffic crossings, students are to&nbsp;<strong>avoid any use of the handphone or listen to music using earphones&nbsp;</strong>as
they may not be alert to oncoming traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students are reminded to use the&nbsp;<strong>designated traffic crossings&nbsp;</strong>when
crossing over to Plantation Avenue from&nbsp;<strong>Yio Chu Kang Road&nbsp;</strong>.
Likewise, when crossing to the school along Serangoon Ave 4, they should
use the&nbsp;<strong>zebra crossing&nbsp;</strong>located behind the gantry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We would also like to alert students entering the school from Gate 4 to
the stretch of yellow tiles on the foot path at the end of Serangoon Ave
4. We have noted that the stretch can be slippery especially when it is
wet. The school is working with LTA to rectify the problem and until this
is so, we have put up temporary signage when it rains to alert students
to the hazard.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Vehicular traffic on the service road during school dismissal</u></em></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We note that some parents park illegally at both sides of the service
road while waiting for their child/ward during school dismissal. This has
caused much traffic congestion and endangers our students as other parents
have to make 3-point turns at different parts of the road in order to exit.
Also, these parked cars are a breach of safety regulations as they prevent
access of emergency vehicles.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We would like to appeal to all parents to refrain from leaving their parked
cars unattended at the service road. While we understand that every parent
is concerned about the convenience and safety of their child/ward, we hope
that you will also consider the safety of other students as well as staff
from both schools.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Use of school driveway</u></em></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Like many other driveways, our school's driveway is designed for passenger
pick-up and drop off only. Parking along the driveway not designed for
that purpose poses a serious safety concern for students and staff especially
when cars are forced to overtake a parked vehicle to exit the school whilst
at the same time, there are other passengers boarding and alighting from
vehicles. Safety is paramount and we look forward to parents' support in
ensuring our school continues to be a safe place for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>2. Security &amp; Screening of Visitors</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>As part of our measures to keep our schools safe, we are constantly reviewing
our security measures. We would like to remind all parents/ guardians to
register with our guard post and put on the visitorâ€™s tag for easy identification.
All visitors are to stay within the General Office and foyer areas unless
otherwise instructed.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We look forward to working with you to ensure the safety for everyone
in the school community. If you have any feedback or queries, do not hesitate
to contact the school at 6202 1260 or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:peicai_ss@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">peicai_ss@moe.edu.sg</a>.</p>
