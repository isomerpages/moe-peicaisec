<h4><strong>1. Road Safety Advisory</strong></h4>
<p><p align="justify">We would like to seek your cooperation to work with the school in ensuring the safety of students coming to and leaving school. This is especially important as students may not have the skills required to use roads properly and do not always fully appreciate the dangers presented. Their physique also makes them less visible to motorists.</p>
<p><strong><u><em>Safe driving for motorists</em></u></strong></p>

<p><strong><u><em>Road Safety for Students</em></u></strong></p>
<img style="width: 65%;" src="/images/sss2.jpg" align = "left" /><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p><p align="justify">All students are reminded to exercise care and be alert when crossing roads. They are to abide by all traffic rules to ensure their personal safety. Students are to&nbsp;<strong>refrain from dashing across the road&nbsp;</strong>without checking for traffic,&nbsp;<strong>even at traffic crossings&nbsp;</strong>. We have reminded our students that they need to slow down and check for traffic as motorists are unable to stop in time if there are sudden movements. Even at traffic crossings, students are to&nbsp;<strong>avoid any use of the handphone or listen to music using earphones&nbsp;</strong>as they may not be alert to oncoming traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<p><p align="justify">Students are reminded to use the&nbsp;<strong>designated traffic crossings&nbsp;</strong>when crossing over to Plantation Avenue from&nbsp;<strong>Yio Chu Kang Road&nbsp;</strong>. Likewise, when crossing to the school along Serangoon Ave 4, they should use the&nbsp;<strong>zebra crossing&nbsp;</strong>located behind the gantry.</p>
<p><p align="justify">We would also like to alert students entering the school from Gate 4 to the stretch of yellow tiles on the foot path at the end of Serangoon Ave 4. We have noted that the stretch can be slippery especially when it is wet. The school is working with LTA to rectify the problem and until this is so, we have put up temporary signage when it rains to alert students to the hazard.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Students cycling to school</u></em></strong></p>
<p><p align="justify">As the roads in Singapore are not built to take into account the safety of cyclists, we discourage students from cycling to school. Hence, we seek your assistance in explaining to your child/ward the safety issues should he/she decide to cycle to school. Students who cycle to school must be granted parental consent. They should obtain the Parent Consent Form from the General Office.</p>
<p><p align="justify">Students who choose to cycle to school are reminded to secure the bicycles in the designated areas and to dismount and push their bicycles when they are within the school premises. They should also put on safety helmets and abide by traffic regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><em><strong>Vehicular traffic on the service road during school dismissal</strong></em></u></p>
<p><p align="justify">We note that some parents park illegally at both sides of the service road while waiting for their child/ward during school dismissal. This has caused much traffic congestion and endangers our students as other parents have to make 3-point turns at different parts of the road in order to exit. Also, these parked cars are a breach of safety regulations as they prevent access of emergency vehicles.&nbsp;</p>
<p><p align="justify">We would like to appeal to all parents to refrain from leaving their parked cars unattended at the service road. While we understand that every parent is concerned about the convenience and safety of their child/ward, we hope that you will also consider the safety of other students as well as staff from both schools.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Use of school driveway</u></em></strong></p>
<p><p align="justify">Like many other driveways, our school's driveway is designed for passenger pick-up and drop off only. Parking along the driveway not designed for that purpose poses a serious safety concern for students and staff especially when cars are forced to overtake a parked vehicle to exit the school whilst at the same time, there are other passengers boarding and alighting from vehicles. Safety is paramount and we look forward to parents' support in ensuring our school continues to be a safe place for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>2. Security &amp; Screening of Visitors</strong></h4>
<p><p align="justify">As part of our measures to keep our schools safe, we are constantly reviewing our security measures. We would like to remind all parents/ guardians to register with our guard post and put on the visitor&rsquo;s tag for easy identification. All visitors are to stay within the General Office and foyer areas unless otherwise instructed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><p align="justify">We look forward to working with you to ensure the safety for everyone in the school community. If you have any feedback or queries, do not hesitate to contact the school at 62884159 or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:peicai_ss@moe.edu.sg">peicai_ss@moe.edu.sg</a>.</p>
