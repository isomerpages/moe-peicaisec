<h4><strong>GROUP PERSONAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE FOR STUDENTS (for Year 2026)</strong></h4>
<p>This is a Group Personal Accident (GPA) Insurance which covers death,
permanent and total/partial disability and medical expenses due to an accident.
The proximate or triggering causes of injuries must be reasonably attributed
to an accident.</p>
<p><strong>Parents/guardian will have to pay for medical treatments upfront, before submitting claims to Income Insurance Limited (Income Insurance) for reimbursement. Please note the applicable limits and coverage for medical expenses. Ineligible expenses or expenses in excess of the limits will be borne by the students/parents/guardian.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Parents/guardian should also take note that medical treatments at private hospitals will typically cost higher, and parents/guardian may need to pay more out-of-pocket expenses if treatment costs exceed the policy’s coverage limits.</strong>
