<td style="width: 50%;"><p align="justify">Bus Captains are a group of unsung heroes who kept Singapore moving during the pandemic. Despite the dangerous and critical situation caused by the contagious virus, they held firm and continue to fulfill their responsibilities of fetching Singaporeans to work and school. Singapore is able to emerge from the pandemic stronger than before due to their effort, We felt that it is time for Peicains to step up to show our gratitude and thanks to our BUs Captains!
