Students enjoyed the novel experience of visiting the court with Mr Josiah and Mr Russell, and sitting in the consultations. Most of the things they did during the week-long attachment were new things that they enjoyed exploring. They found Mr Josephus Tan’s sharing to be very authentic and inspiring. They also appreciated the patience shown to them by their mentors.
