<p></p><p align="justify"><strong><em>Seek. Make. Advocate</em></strong>&nbsp;is a unique, research-backed programme co-created with the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) that aims to develop Design Innovation mindsets, digital literacy and cross-disciplinary thinking skills in our students.</p>

<p><strong>Desired Outcomes</strong></p>
<p></p><p align="justify">Students will acquire<strong>&nbsp;21CC</strong>&nbsp;(Critical and Innovative Thinking, Collaboration, Communication),&nbsp;<strong>Digital Literacy</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Life Skills</strong>&nbsp;such as resilience and adaptability, by embarking on the&nbsp;<strong>cross-disciplinary</strong>&nbsp;project-based learning that integrates&nbsp;<strong>knowledge and skills of STEAM</strong>&nbsp;(Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics), and&nbsp;<strong>practices of design thinking</strong>, enabling them to be&nbsp;<strong>future-ready</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Programme Overview</strong></p>
<p></p><p align="justify">In Tier 1 of the programme, a blended learning approach will be used to allow students to tinker and experiment with ideas, technologies and skills. They will be exposed to social causes such as environmental care and protection, gender equality and inclusivity for special needs amongst others, and equipped with technological skills like coding, video editing and data analytics. Students will then work collaboratively in groups to come up with technology-based solutions to solve or advocate for their identified social causes.</p>
