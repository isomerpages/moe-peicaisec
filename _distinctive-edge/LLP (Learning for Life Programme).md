<p>In Peicai, we aim to develop in our students</p>
<ul>
<li>Leadership Through and For the Community</li>
</ul>
<p></p><p align="justify">Students demonstrate personal mastery and manifest socio-emotional competencies and values which make a positive difference to the community and become persons for others.</p>

<h4><strong>Secondary One</strong></h4>
<p></p><p align="justify">At the Secondary One level, Peicaians get the opportunity to work with SPD to develop studentsâ€™ understanding of the experiences of persons with disabilities and benefit SPD by providing a platform to raise awareness about the challenges persons with disabilities encounter in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Secondary Two</strong></h4>
<p></p><p align="justify">At the Secondary Two level, Peicaians are given autonomy to decide and plan their VIA projects. As a class, they choose and decide on the community which they would like to focus on and they also get to choose the organisations that they would like their projects to impact.</p>

<h4><strong>Secondary Three</strong></h4>
<p></p><p align="justify">For the Secondary Three students, they are also involved in the Pass-It-On project in which they have to be advocates for the cause that they have selected. Upon completion of their VIA projects, they will visit primary schools and create awareness of their selected cause in the primary school students.</p>
