<p><strong>CCA Matters</strong>
</p>
<p>CCAs are an integral part of a student’s school life and holistic development.
It is compulsory for all students to have at least one CCA.</p>
<p>The school will be organising a CCA Open House during the Sec 1 Parents’
Engagement Session to help students and parents make a well-considered
decision on their choice of CCA.</p>
<p>All Secondary One students would be able to indicate their three preferred
CCA options via an online option form. The link details will be sent via
PG at a later date.</p>
