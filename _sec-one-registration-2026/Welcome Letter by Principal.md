<p><strong><u>Principal’s Welcome Letter for Secondary One Cohort (2026)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians of Secondary One Students</p>
<p><strong>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Congratulations
on your child’s/ward’s successful completion of the Primary School Leaving
Examination (PSLE) as well as on your child’s/ward’s admission to Peicai
Secondary School (PCSS)!</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are happy to extend a very warm welcome to the students and parents
of the Secondary One cohort for 2026.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As announced by the Ministry of Education (MOE), students do not need to
report to their posted secondary schools after receiving their S1 Posting
Results. Instead, students should refer to their posted schools' websites
for the registration details.</p>
<p><strong>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>For
our school, you would see a tab titled “<strong>Secondary One Registration 2026</strong>”
on the main page of our school website where you would be able to access
the relevant information.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can also expect to receive additional instructions from the school
via Parents Gateway from 30 December 2025 (Tue) 5:00pm.</p>
<p><strong>6</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All parents will be informed of the Secondary One Form Class allocation
as well as the names and email addresses of the Form Teachers for their
child via Parents Gateway by 5:00pm on 30 December 2025 (Tue).</p>
<p><strong>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>We
encourage all parents to be a member of the school’s Parent Support Group
as it would connect you with other parents with whom you would be able
to interact and share ideas as well as thoughts on how you could further
support your child in his/her journey as a teenager. You can indicate your
interest to join the Parent Support Group via the <em>Secondary One Registration Form 2026</em> sent
via Parents Gateway.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Please check our school website at <a href="https://www.peicaisec.moe.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.peicaisec.moe.edu.sg/</a> for
regular updates and announcements.&nbsp; Should you have any queries on
Secondary One Matters, you may contact Ms Ng Si Ying, LH Math overseeing
Secondary One Registration Matters, at <a href="mailto:ng_si_ying@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ng_si_ying@moe.edu.sg</a> or email the
school at <strong>peicai_ss@moe.edu.sg</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>9</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
look forward to your strong support in providing an enriching and rewarding
educational journey for all our students. I would also like to take this
opportunity to wish you and your family members a very Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>Mr Michael Muhunthan</p>
