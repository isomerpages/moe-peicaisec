<p>Students should only alight/be picked up at designated venues in the school.</p>
<p>Like many other driveways, our school's driveway is designed for passenger
pick-up and drop off only. Any parking along the driveway not designed
for that purpose poses a serious safety concern for students and staff.
Hence, parking or waiting is strictly not allowed in the school’s driveway.</p>
<p>As parking lots in the school premises are very limited, parents/guardians
who drive to school for appointments or are waiting to pick up their child/ward
can park their cars at the HDB carparks nearby (carparks for Blocks 218
- 222, Serangoon Avenue 4).</p>
<p>All visitors to the school, including parents/ guardians, would need to
register at the guard post and put on the visitor tag at all times whilst
in school for easy identification.</p>

find out more about school safety and security.</p>
<p>We seek the support and co-operation of parents /guardians on all safety
and security matters to ensure the safety of all students in school.</p>
