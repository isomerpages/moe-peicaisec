<p>Students entering Secondary One in January 2026 will be issued with a
new Secondary level School Smart Card (SSC). The delivery dates for the
SSCs will be made known in due course.</p>
<p>While Secondary One students are waiting for their Secondary level SSCs
to be ready, they can continue to use their Primary level SSCs for concessionary
travel till end April 2026. Students can still purchase the Bus Concession
Pass (BCP) using their Primary level SSCs but they would need to purchase
the BCP for Secondary School students.</p>
