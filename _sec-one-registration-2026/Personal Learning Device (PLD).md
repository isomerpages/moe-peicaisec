<p><u>Introduction</u>
</p>
<p>MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) in March 2020
for all schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy.</p>
<p>One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised
Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby
every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning
Device (PLD).</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>PLDs in Teaching and Learning</u>
</p>
<p>Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) have tremendous potential to transform
the learning environment as it enables teachers and students to harness
technology for greater effectiveness in teaching and learning. The use
of the PLDs for teaching and learning will also support the development
of digital literacies in our students as well as develop them as future
ready self-directed and collaborative learners.</p>
<p><u>Choice of PLD in Peicai Secondary School</u>
</p>
<p>The school is using the <strong>Apple iPad (A16) 11” (128 GB)</strong> as
its choice for the PLD for all students. The device bundle includes a 4-year
AppleCare+ warranty, 4-year insurance, an Apple Pencil (USB-C), and a Logitech
keyboard with cover.</p>
