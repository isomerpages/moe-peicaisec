<p>To foster strong class spirit in an otherwise diverse profile of students,
our school will be allocating students based on the social causes which
they would like to advocate for.</p>
<p>Through school programmes such as the Applied Learning Programme (ALP)
(<a href="https://www.peicaisec.moe.edu.sg/distinctive-edge/alp-applied-learning-programme/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.peicaisec.moe.edu.sg/distinctive-edge/alp-applied-learning-programme/</a>)
and the Values-In-Action (VIA) programme, students in the same form class
will be advocating for a common cause for the betterment of the environment
and society.</p>
<p>We <strong><em>strongly encourage</em></strong> you to <strong>discuss the choice of social cause with your child/ward</strong> before
submitting your response. This ensures the choice reflects their genuine
interest, as they will be classed according to their selected cause and
participate in related research and activities in programmes like ALP and
VIA. When students select causes they <strong>truly care about</strong>,
they stay <strong>more engaged</strong> and <strong>benefit more deeply</strong> from
the experience.</p>
<p>The list of social causes, as well as the accompanying brief descriptions,
is as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Animal welfare</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Advocating for animal welfare as a social issue that reflects how we live
and make choices as a society. Animals, not only pets but also wildlife
and farm animals, are affected by human actions such as neglect, exploitation,
and unsustainable practices. How we treat animals speaks to our values
of empathy, responsibility, and care for life. Through this theme, I want
to explore the social and environmental factors that impact animal welfare,
including public awareness, consumer choices, and human behaviour. I aim
to design digital solutions that encourage empathy, responsible actions,
and better care for animals, contributing to a more humane and sustainable
world.</p>

<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>

</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Exploring how artificial intelligence (AI) is shaping the way we live,
learn, and make decisions as a society. From recommendation algorithms
to AI-generated content, AI increasingly influences what we see, think,
and choose. When AI is designed or used without care, it can lead to unfair
outcomes, bias, and loss of trust. Through this theme, I want to understand
the ethical issues surrounding AI, such as fairness, responsibility, transparency,
and accountability. I aim to design digital solutions that promote responsible,
ethical, and thoughtful design and use of AI, so that technology serves
people and society in positive and fair ways.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Promoting Cyber Wellness by helping people use the online space safely,
responsibly, and respectfully. In today’s digital world, young people are
spending more time online, often without close supervision, which makes
positive online behaviours and awareness increasingly important. Through
this theme, I want to explore how our online actions affect others and
how we can prevent harm such as cyberbullying, misinformation, and unsafe
digital practices. I aim to design digital solutions that encourage responsible
online behaviour and help create a safer, more positive digital environment
for everyone.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Caring for and protecting the environment by addressing climate change
and its impact on people and nature. Rising temperatures, extreme weather,
and environmental damage are made worse by unsustainable habits and practices.
Through this theme, I want to explore how everyday choices and responsible
actions can help protect natural resources and reduce our impact on the
Earth. I aim to design digital solutions that encourage more sustainable
behaviours and support a healthier, more resilient planet.</p>

<p><strong>Health &amp; Active Living</strong>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Promoting health and active living as a growing social issue in a fast-paced
and increasingly sedentary society. Many people, both young and old, struggle
to stay physically active due to busy routines, screen-heavy lifestyles,
and environments that do not always support movement. These challenges
can affect overall well-being and quality of life. Through this theme,
I want to explore how our environments and choices can better support healthy
and active lifestyles across different ages. I aim to design digital solutions
that encourage healthy, active living and support everyday well-being.</p>

<p><strong>Mental Wellness</strong>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Promoting mental wellness by helping people understand, care for, and
strengthen their emotional well-being. In today’s fast-paced world, many
young people experience stress from studies, friendships, family expectations,
and digital life. Through this theme, I want to explore how positive habits,
supportive relationships, and healthy coping strategies can help individuals
maintain emotional balance and resilience. I aim to design digital solutions
that support mental wellness, encourage help-seeking, and promote healthier
ways of coping with stress and challenges.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Strengthening social cohesion by nurturing our shared identity as Singaporeans
and helping people from different backgrounds, cultures, and generations
live and work together with understanding and respect. In a diverse and
fast-changing society, differences and misunderstandings can sometimes
weaken trust and a sense of belonging. Through this theme, I want to explore
what brings us together as Singaporeans and what helps people connect across
differences. I aim to design digital solutions that strengthen shared identity,
encourage respectful interaction, and contribute to a more united and harmonious
Singapore society.</p>
