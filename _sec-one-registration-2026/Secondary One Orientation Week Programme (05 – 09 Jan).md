The Secondary One Orientation Programme is a key milestone programme for
all Secondary One students as they begin their educational journey in a
secondary school.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The objectives of the Orientation programme are as follows:</p>
<p>(a) to enable Secondary One students to assimilate into their new school
environment</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; to get to know the Form Teachers and classmates better</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; to instill a sense of pride and sense of belonging in
the school</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As part of Start Smart and Orientation Week, students will also learn about
new subjects they would be studying at the secondary level including the
Humanities, Craft &amp; Technology, Computer Applications (G1 only) as
well as about the Applied Learning Programme (ALP).</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
