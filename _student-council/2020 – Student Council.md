<h4><strong>Student Leaders Investiture 2020</strong></h4>
<p>Student Leaders Investiture 2020 had to be run differently because of
the times we live in but the 11th Student Council Executive Committee rose
to the challenge and digitised the programme.</p>
<h4><strong>EXCO Leadership Challenge 2020</strong></h4>
<p>The 12th Student Council Executive Committee came together for the annual
EXCO leadership training. Over the course of the 2 days, EXCO12 modelled,
challenged, inspired, enabled and encouraged. Taking steps towards building
their EXCO family, EXCO12 is raring and ready to leader the Student Council
forward!</p>
<p>“ELC20 was very eye-opening for me as I got to know my fellow EXCOs better
and understand why they are how they are. It reaffirmed my hope that EXCO12
would get closer as time goes by and become the family that I know we can
be!” – Lois Lio, 3C1, Hd Logistics, EXCO12</p>
<h4><strong>Teachers' Day Celebrations 2020 - Wanderlust</strong></h4>
<p>Despite the challenge of 2020, the Student Council challenged the processed
and ith a live virtual concert. The Student Council brought the school
together to celebrate the impact the teachers have made in the lives of
all Peicaians.</p>
<p>"We know that the staff members of our school have sacrificed so much
for the sake of us students and that nothing we do can truly repay them.
Through this small effort, the Council hopes to represent the student body
in appreciating them. To my fellow Peicaians, instead of us appreciating
our teachers annually, just once a year, why not make it a daily affair.
Truth be told, I think our teachers would appreciate our small gestures
of gratitude on a daily basis rather than a once-off grand affair. As we
approach the rest of the year, let’s take the initiative and make it habit
to do it daily." - Kieron Lye, 3C1, President,</p>
