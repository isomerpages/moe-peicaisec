<p dir="ltr">The evening of 12 April 2019 was a significant moment as Peicai invested a total of 173 students into various leadership appointments. Amongst them, 14 graduating student leaders were appointed to the rank of Senior Student Councillor for their invaluable service to the school.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><em>Senior Student Councillors</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">The theme this year is "Discover Self, Inspire Others" and through it, we hope that the invested leaders would discover their own strengths and leadership styles as they embark on their leadership journey, and eventually develop into a unique leader who inspires others to take on challenges with a positive attitude!</p>
