<p>Racial Harmony Day was commemorated in school in Week 4 of Term 3 from
the 21<sup>st</sup> July (Monday) to 25<sup>th</sup> July (Friday).</p>
<p>The theme for Racial Harmony Day (RHD) , ‘Our People, Our Tapestry’, reminds
us that the diverse cultural threads in our society are intricately intertwined,
working together to form a vibrant and unified whole. The objective of
RHD is to help students recognise the importance of mutual understanding,
appreciation, and respect among our various ethnic communities ; all of
which are key to preserving the strength and harmony of our multicultural
society.</p>
<p>This year, our RHD commemoration continued to deepen students’ awareness
that cultural expression takes many forms. In keeping with the theme, the
focus remained on ethnic food and snacks; always a crowd favourite and
with an exciting new addition: ethnic games.</p>
<p>It was heartening to see our students and teachers coming together during
CCE lessons to bring, share and enjoy a wide array of traditional snacks
and games. The classroom celebrations were filled with laughter, curiosity,
and rich conversations. The lively demonstrations of Kabaddi, Wushu, and
Sepak Raga further engaged our students, sparking interest in traditional
ethnic sports and highlighting the diversity of expression across cultures.</p>
<p>During recess, the interactive ethnic games booth was a popular attraction,
where students enthusiastically participated in nostalgic games such as
5 Stones, Chapteh, and Congkak. Their enthusiasm and openness to explore
reflected the heart of Racial Harmony Day: &nbsp;a celebration of shared
experiences and cultural learning.</p>
<p>The commemoration would not have been possible without the dedication
of our teachers and the wholehearted participation of our students. Together,
they helped bring the theme “Our People, Our Tapestry” to life in meaningful
and memorable ways.</p>
