<p>On 1 July 2025, Peicai Secondary School commemorated NCC Day with a solemn
ceremony during Morning Assembly. In alignment with the Singapore Armed
Forces (SAF) Day, our cadets joined hands with servicemen across the nation
in renewing their commitment to defend our country. A key highlight of
the ceremony was the screening of an inspiring video message by Brigadier-General
(Ret) Lam Shiu Tong, Chairman of the National Cadet Corps Council.</p>

<p>Proudly standing in unity and discipline — our NCC (Sea) cadets commemorating
NCC Day with honour and pride at Peicai Secondary School.</p>
<p>In his address, BG (Ret) Lam reminded cadets of the shared responsibility
that youth hold in Singapore’s defence and the importance of growing as
resilient, committed and fit individuals. Following the message, our NCC
cadets stood proudly to take the NCC Pledge, reaffirming their role in
upholding the values of Total Defence and exemplifying the spirit of service
and leadership.</p>
<p>The ceremony aimed to deepen students’ appreciation of NCC’s mission —
to nurture extraordinary leaders anchored in the pillars of a Resilient
Mind, Committed Heart, and Fit Body. This meaningful occasion involved
our NCC cadets, teacher officers, and the wider school community, serving
as a powerful reminder that the duty of safeguarding Singapore begins with
each one of us — including our youth</p>
