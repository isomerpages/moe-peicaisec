<h4><strong>Modern Dance CCA Performance and Infocomm Club Volunteers at Kampong Serangoon National Day Dinner 2025</strong></h4>
<p>On 26 July 2025 (Saturday), our school’s Modern Dance CCA had the honour
of performing at the Kampong Serangoon National Day Dinner 2025, held at
the Open Field near Blk 217 Serangoon Avenue 4.This meaningful celebration
brought together residents from all walks of life to commemorate Singapore’s
60th birthday and reignite the true Kampong Serangoon spirit through a
night of community bonding and festive cheer.</p>
<p>Graced by Senior Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong and Ms Chan Hui Yuh, Adviser
to Aljunied GRC Grassroots Organisations, the event was a powerful reminder
of our shared heritage and hopes for the future.</p>
<p>Our dancers took to the stage with a rousing performance titled "Rhythms
of a Nation". In celebration of Singapore’s 60 years of independence, the
dance paid tribute to the nation’s extraordinary journey with a vibrant
medley of songs in multiple languages. Through dynamic choreography, incorporation
of colourful sashes in the dance, and energetic movements, the piece showcased
the rich cultural tapestry that makes Singapore our home.</p>

<p>The passion and unity displayed on stage captured the spirit of the evening,
and we are proud of our dancers for representing the school with such grace
and enthusiasm. Congratulations to the Modern Dance CCA on a successful
and meaningful performance!</p>
<p>In addition, three students from the school’s Infocomm Club rendered their
assistance as volunteers at the Serangoon National Kampong Dinner. They
were responsible for the distribution of pamphlets to over 150 tables and
took charge of the preparation of cakes and goodie bags for each table.
The students also supported the logistical arrangements by assisting with
the movement and placement of chairs, thereby contributing to the seamless
execution of the event programme.</p>
