<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students who are unable to collect their results

collect a physical copy on their behalf. The proxy must present (a) their
identification card and (b) an authorisation letter for verification by
the school. Results can be collected at the General Office at 3.00 pm on
10 January.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students or their proxies who are unable to collect
the result slips on the day of the results release must make an appointment
with the school before coming down on other days to collect them.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents or guardians accompanying their
child or ward must register at the security post and wear a visitor tag
for easy identification.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only staff with approved season parking decals may
use the parking lots within the school compound, including the five along
