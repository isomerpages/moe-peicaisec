<h4><strong>Peicai Featured on <em>Zaobao Schools</em> for Meaningful Visit to Blood Bank@HSA</strong></h4>
<p>Peicai Secondary School was recently featured on <strong><em>Zaobao Schools</em></strong> for
a heartfelt and inspiring visit to the <strong>Blood Bank@HSA</strong> on <strong>Thursday, 17 April 2025</strong>.
The article highlighted the reflections of our students and their participation
in the <strong>Students’ Work Attachment Programme (SWAP)</strong>, which
offered them a closer look into the vital work of blood donation in Singapore.</p>
<p>During the visit, our students — <strong>Macha Abhigna (4C1)</strong>, <strong>Kyle Ong (4B3)</strong>,
and <strong>Garnell Krystyn (4B3)</strong> — shared their experiences and
learning in the <em>Zaobao Schools</em> feature. Many Secondary 3 students
also expressed deep appreciation for the dedication and care shown by the
blood bank staff, and were inspired by the stories of donors and recipients
whose lives have been transformed by the gift of blood.</p>
<p>This Signature Community Outreach project forms part of Peicai’s ongoing
commitment to nurture empathy, civic-mindedness, and appreciation in our
students. We are proud of them for engaging sincerely and representing
the school with integrity and heart.</p>
<p>We would also like to express our heartfelt thanks to the team at <strong>Blood Bank@HSA</strong> for
their warm hospitality and inspiration, and to <strong>Ya Kun Kaya Toast</strong> for
generously sponsoring <strong>30 sets of kaya toast</strong>, making the
visit more memorable and meaningful.</p>
