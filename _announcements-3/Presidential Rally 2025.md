<h3><strong>Student Council Presidential Elections 2025</strong></h3>
<p><strong><u>17th Student Council Presidential Rally 2025: Leadership in Action</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The annual Student Council Presidential Rally, masterfully orchestrated
by the 16th Executive Committee, showcased student leadership at its finest
as five exceptional candidates presented their vision for the school's
future. Held in the school multi-purpose hall, the event drew an impressive
turnout of students, teachers, and staff members, all eager to hear from
their potential student president.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the rally was to provide a platform for presidential
candidates to articulate their manifestos and electoral symbols as seen
in Fig. 1 and connect directly with the student body. This democratic process,
entirely student-led, demonstrated the remarkable capability of Peicai's
student leaders in organising and managing significant school events.</p>

<p>The 16th Executive Committee demonstrated exemplary leadership throughout
the event, sharing valuable insights and advice with the presidential candidates.
Their guidance, drawn from their own experiences, added a meaningful mentorship
dimension to the rally, creating a beautiful display of leadership succession
and student agency in action.</p>
<p>The five candidates, each bringing unique perspectives and leadership
styles, took turns addressing the audience. Their presentations demonstrated
thorough preparation and genuine passion for serving the student body.
What set this year's rally apart was the innovative use of Instagram's
Q&amp;A function as seen in Fig. 2, which allowed both students and members
of the public to submit their questions before the rally. This digital
integration, onceptualized and implemented by the student leaders, made
the event more interactive and accessible than ever before.</p>
