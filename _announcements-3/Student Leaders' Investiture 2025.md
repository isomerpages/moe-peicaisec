<h4><strong>Student Leaders' Investiture 2025</strong></h4>
<p>The school multi-purpose hall buzzed with excitement as Peicai Secondary
School celebrated its Student Leaders' Investiture 2025. The ceremony kicked
off with an energetic march-in, as student leaders from all three wings
made their entrance to upbeat music. Class photos flashed across the screen
while Class Committee Leaders, CCA Leaders, and Student Councillors walked
in proudly, each carrying items that symbolised their leadership roles.</p>

<p>Vice-Principal Ms Jesmine Chung set the tone for the morning with a heartfelt
address that struck a chord with everyone present. She posed three simple
yet powerful questions to the leaders: "What's new? What's next? What's
better?" Her message was clear – leadership isn't about making dramatic
changes, but about having the grit to push through challenges and the ingenuity
to make meaningful differences in school life.</p>

<p>The badge presentation ceremony was a proud moment for both students and
parents watching from the audience. Vice-Principals Mr Shue Pei Yan and
Ms Jesmine Chung personally pinned badges on each CCA head and the 17th
Executive Committee members, sharing warm handshakes and words of encouragement.
The gravity of the moment was visible on the faces of the young leaders
as they received their badges, marking their official step into leadership
roles.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most touching moments came near the end of the ceremony. Outgoing
president Kirsten Chloe shared her journey with genuine emotion, speaking
about the ups and downs of leadership and how they shaped her. Her words
resonated with many, especially when she spoke about the lessons learned
from challenges faced during her tenure. Following her reflection, incoming
president Benson Ling stepped up to share his hopes and plans for the year
ahead, his enthusiasm infectious as he spoke about continuing the legacy
while charting new paths.</p>
