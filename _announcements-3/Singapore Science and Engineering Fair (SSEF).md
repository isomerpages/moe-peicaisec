<h4>Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF)</h4>
<p>5 Peicaians took part in the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF)

solving, and scientific research. Their studies on seed priming and food
waste as natural hair dye aimed to promote innovation in both agriculture
and personal care, advancing scientific knowledge for a more productive
and sustainable future.</p>
