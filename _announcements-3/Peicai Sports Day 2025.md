<h4><strong>Peicai Sports Day 2025</strong></h4>
<p>The Secondary 1 The glowing morning sun at Serangoon stadium provided
a sense of vibrance and anticipation to this year’s edition of Peicai Sports
Day.</p>
<p>Aimed not just to build the physical fitness and mental resilience of
our students, the exposure to athletics meant that students’ knowledge
to a range of sporting events both as an actual running participant as
well as an audience member, is widened. On top of it all, Peicai Sports
Day fosters a healthy competitive sporting culture, that serves to strengthen
class and school spirit. With HOD PE CCA Mr Alvin Yeo covering commentary
alongside Student Council EXCO’s Isaac Hoon Mirante, the event looks set
to come alive!</p>

<p>There were quite a few storied rivalries on the track in this year’s edition.
One of these, was the clash amongst best friends; Muhd Ilhami, Kasyful
Fareez and Aiman was one of the must-see competitions in the 200 meters
upper secondary boys event.</p>
<p>Finishing first, second and fourth respectively in 2023, they were hoping
to upstage one another, given this opportunity at the newly-renovated Serangoon
track. Ilhami though, had other ideas, as he blitzed through the curve
in first place, and never looked back, taking down Nikhil Jayden’s 2023
record by 0.17 seconds, touching the finish line at 25.61 seconds, properly
cementing his legacy as the fastest-ever 200m runner in Peicai, holding
both the lower and upper secondary category records.</p>

<p>Another rivalry that continued this year was the challenge of Samantha
Sonya against Lola Jane Wilkinson, also in the 200 meters event. Both student
athletes were neck-and-neck at the 150<sup>th</sup> meter mark, and it was
only in the last 40-50 meters that Lola peeled away to score a win against
her rival, who is 1-year younger than Lola.</p>

<p>The emergence of the parents’ team in the staff-parents race cannot be
underestimated, as both parents’ team started off very well and PSG (Parents
Support Group) Team A was holding a commanding lead all the way till the
anchor leg. Alas, they were chased down by hot favourites, the Science
Department, led by HOD Science Mr Edwin Kwek, who managed to cut down the
40-meter deficit to score a win once again.</p>

<p>At the end of the event, our esteemed guest of honour, Vice-President
of the Singapore National Olympic Council and soon-to-be Secretary General,
Mr Mark Chay shared a few words of inspiration to encourage Peicaians to
aspire to be even greater, before giving out many of the prizes to all
award winners. Our Principal, Mr Michael then capped off the wonderful
event by applauding the efforts of the various classes in bringing up class
spirit by cheering on their classmates with poms-poms, support placards
and even banner flags of their classes.</p>
<p>We look forward to the next edition in 2026!</p>
