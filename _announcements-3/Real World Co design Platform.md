<p>Peicai Secondary School, in collaboration with the DesignSingapore Council,
Design Exchange, and sponsored by the James Dyson Foundation (JDF), launched
the Real World Co-design Platform (RWCDP), from 3 Aug 2024 to 8 February
2025, to provide 23 students with an immersive Design Thinking experience.
This initiative provided a unique opportunity for students, teachers and
parents to collaborate in the co-design process. As the sessions progressed,
all five teams became highly engaged and competitive, striving to make
a meaningful impact by contributing ideas for the redesign of the school
pond area. At the final workshop session, the presence of external judges
from Design Exchange and the James Dyson Foundation, both esteemed design
practitioners, further enhanced the experience by offering professional
insights and adding a real-world dimension to the project. RWCDP not only
equipped students with real-world problem-solving skills but also nurtured
a mindset of curiosity, collaboration, and innovation, preparing them to
be future-ready learners and responsible citizens.</p>
