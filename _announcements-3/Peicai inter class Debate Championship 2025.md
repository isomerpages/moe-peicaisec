<h4><strong>Peicai inter-class Debate Championship 2025</strong></h4>
<p>The Inter-Class Debating Championship is an annual tournament helmed by
the English Department. It serves as an exciting and engaging platform
for students to hone their public speaking, critical thinking, communication
and collaboration skills.</p>
<p>Each Secondary 3 class will send a team of five students to compete against
one another in the various debating rounds (preliminary, semi-final and
the Grand Final round). Teams will be assigned a motion to debate on and
assigned either the side of proposition or opposition. The debaters will
proceed to develop their main arguments and prepare their speeches, supported
by evidence and statistics that they have selected during the research
phase. The Grand Final of the Inter-Class Debating Championship was held
during the assembly programme in front of the entire school, and adjudicated
by Mr Keith Teo, Ms Daphne Lim, and Mr Mark Gabriel from the Julia Gabriel
Centre. Mr Mark Gabriel shared his overall feedback for the debate round
and offered insights on both the public speaking and persuasive skills
for the debaters as well as the content and structure of each speech.</p>
<p>The Peicai inter-class Debate Championship 2025 has successfully concluded,
and English Language Department would like to extend our appreciation to
everyone for supporting the event to give the debaters an opportunity to
hone their critical thinking skills as well as develop effective communication
skills.</p>
