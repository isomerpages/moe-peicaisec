<p>On 26 September 2025, our Secondary 4 and 5 students celebrated their
milestone at the annual Graduation Night. The evening was filled with laughter,
joy, and heartfelt moments as students reflected on their journey in Peicai
and the friendships they had built over the years.</p>
<p>The students were treated to a sumptuous buffet, as well as an array of
song and dance performances that added to the celebratory atmosphere. Teachers
and students came together to share fond memories and express appreciation
for one another, making it a truly memorable and meaningful occasion.</p>
<p>As the night drew to a close, the hall was filled with smiles and warm
farewells — a fitting end to the students’ secondary school journey and
a new beginning for the adventures ahead.</p>
