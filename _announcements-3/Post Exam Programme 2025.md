<p>A myriad of Post exam programmes were planned for our students from 16
October and 21-23 October 2025. The students had the opportunity to take
part in various learning activities such as learning journeys to different
organisations as well as educational talks.</p>
<p>The students also took part in the annual sports challenge whereby they
competed other their peers in a spirit of teamwork and healthy competition.
Through these activities, students not only strengthened their physical
fitness but also developed important life skills such as resilience, collaboration,
and sportsmanship.</p>
<p>The Post-Exam Programme provided a meaningful conclusion to the academic
year, giving students the chance to learn beyond the classroom and build
lasting memories with their classmates and teachers.</p>
