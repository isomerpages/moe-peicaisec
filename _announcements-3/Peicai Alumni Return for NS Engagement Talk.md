<p>We were honoured to welcome back Peicai alumni Ivan Phua and Wong Ziqi,
who shared their National Service (NS) experiences with the Secondary 3
cohort. They provided insights into the physical demands and resilience
required in NS, while highlighting its vital role in safeguarding Singapore’s
security and sustaining the nation’s economic development. Their visit
served as a meaningful reminder of the enduring bonds our graduates maintain
with Peicai and their commitment to inspiring the next generation.</p>

<p>During the session, both Ivan and Ziqi highlighted how teamwork, discipline,
and perseverance shaped their growth, both as individuals and as members
of a larger community. Their stories offered students an authentic glimpse
into NS life, breaking misconceptions and providing reassurance as they
look ahead to their future responsibilities.</p>
<p>Ivan also encouraged students not to fear NS, reminding them that “it’s
not punishment, it’s preparation”. He shared that while NS will test them,
it will also shape them. With the right mindset, they can grow through
every challenge, respect the process, and carry its lessons into life beyond.</p>
<p>Ziqi emphasised that NS is built on pride and purpose, a commitment to
protect what we love. He highlighted Singapore’s advanced defence systems,
dedicated soldiers, and strong deterrence efforts, reminding students that
every serviceman contributes to the nation’s safety and stability with
honour and responsibility.</p>

the spirit of giving back.</p>
