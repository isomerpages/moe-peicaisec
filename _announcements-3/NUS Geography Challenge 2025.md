<p>A team of four students represented the school at the NUS Geography Challenge
2025 in March this year. The NUS Geography Challenge is an annual competition
organized by the National University of Singapore Department of Geography,
in collaboration with the NUS Geographical Society and with support from
the Ministry of Education. The competition hopes to ignite the passion&nbsp;of&nbsp;secondary
school students and inspire them to develop a keen interest in the dynamic
discipline&nbsp;of&nbsp;Geography. Through this challenge, students will
learn about world issues and how&nbsp;Geography&nbsp;can empower them to
respond to these issues.</p>
<p>The team, comprising of Bernice Chen Qianning (3CN), Raynise Tan Yi Xuan
(3CN), Pimentel Maria Michaela Benavidez (3CN) and Castillo Zian Denver
Menciano (3EE), competed against 472 students from 118 schools in both
the individual and team components. The components tested not only their
understanding of geographical concepts but also their ability to think
critically to problem-solve and collaborate effectively under the pressure
of time. In preparation for the competition, the students committed many
hours to study sessions and practice quizzes and their dedication was evident
throughout the event.</p>
<p>Despite the strong competition, we are pleased to announce that Bernice
Chen Qianning (3CN) has attained the Bronze Award for the Individual Component.</p>
<p>We congratulate the Geography team for their admirable achievements and
thank all staff and parents who supported them throughout this preparation.
Their achievement has indeed reflected the strength of our school's commitment
to academic excellence and holistic development.</p>
<p>Well done to our Geography stars!</p>
