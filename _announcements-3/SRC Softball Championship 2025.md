<p>The C Division Softball boys and girls participated in the Singapore Recreation
Club Softball Championship 2025 over the March holidays. Despite the challenging
weather and several postponements, our Softballers were resilient and played
well. Special mention to our youngest players, the Secondary Ones, who
played their first game representing Peicai with pride and perseverance!
Also, we would like to thank the parents who came down to support our players,
armed with subway cookies, bread, fruits and energy drinks!</p>
