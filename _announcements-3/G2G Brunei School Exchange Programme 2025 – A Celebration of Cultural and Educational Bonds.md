<h4><strong>G2G Brunei School Exchange Programme 2025 – A Celebration of Cultural and Educational Bonds</strong></h4>
<p>23 May 2025 marked the conclusion of the G2G Brunei School Exchange Programme,
a five-day immersive experience (from 19 – 23 May 2025) that brought together
students and educators from Brunei and Singapore. Our Vice-Principal, Ms
Chung, along with Ms Jacelyn and Mr Kelvin Leong, bid a warm farewell to
the Bruneian delegation after a week of shared learning, friendship, and
meaningful cultural exchange.</p>
<p>Throughout the programme, Bruneian students spent most of their time in
our school with their Peicai buddies — our very own G2G Brunei Student
Ambassadors — engaging in a range of academic and co-curricular activities.
These interactions offered a unique window into school life in Singapore
and fostered genuine cross-cultural friendships.</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom, the delegation explored Singapore’s rich multicultural
heritage through visits to iconic cultural sites such as <strong>Kampong Glam</strong>, <strong>Chinatown</strong>,
and <strong>Gardens by the Bay</strong>. These excursions deepened their
understanding of Singapore’s diversity and allowed for experiential learning
in an urban, multicultural context.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, educators from both countries engaged in insightful conversations
on educational practices, exchanging ideas on pedagogy, curriculum innovation,
and student development. It was a valuable platform for professional exchange
and future collaboration.</p>
<p>This programme’s success was made possible thanks to the contributions
of many dedicated individuals. We would like to express our heartfelt appreciation
to all the teachers, school staff and students who contributed to the success
of this programme.</p>
