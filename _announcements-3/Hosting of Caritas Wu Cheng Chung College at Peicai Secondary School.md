<h4><strong>Hosting of Caritas Wu Cheng Chung College at Peicai Secondary School</strong></h4>
<p>On 30th April, Peicai Secondary School had the pleasure of welcoming students
and staff from Caritas Wu Cheng Chung College (CWCC), Hong Kong. This meaningful
visit was part of our commitment to nurturing a global outlook and providing
authentic opportunities for cultural exchange and learning beyond the classroom,
and the Peicai OSEP team had visited CWCC back in November 2024.</p>
<p>The visiting group spent a full day at our school, touring our school
campus and participating in a variety of engaging workshops. CWCC students
were warmly received by our Peicai buddies at the foyer in the morning.
It was a meaningful reunion and a wonderful opportunity for the students
to reconnect with their buddies and strengthen the bonds of friendship.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, students enjoyed a mix of sports and arts activities
— from a spirited Ultimate Frisbee game; to creating their own personalised
keychains. These hands-on sessions encouraged teamwork, creativity, and
cultural exchange.</p>

<p>CWCC students were also given the opportunity to participate in lesson
experiences from our signature Applied Learning Programme (STEAM &amp;
Design Thinking) by Ms Lee Li Juan and Mr Vincent Siew, as well as a Humanities
workshop led by Ms Ng Xin. In recognition of this special exchange, Peicai
Secondary School presented a commemorative plaque to CWCC, symbolising
our growing friendship and ongoing partnership.</p>

<p>Through this visit, our students not only built meaningful relationships
but also honed key 21st Century Competencies — including civic literacy,
global awareness, and cross-cultural skills — preparing them to thrive
in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
<p>We extend our sincere thanks to CWCC for joining us this year and look
forward to continued collaboration and deeper cultural exchanges on our
return trip to their college this November!</p>
