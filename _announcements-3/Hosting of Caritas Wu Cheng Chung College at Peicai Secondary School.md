<h4><strong>Hosting of Caritas Wu Cheng Chung College at Peicai Secondary School</strong></h4>
<p>On 30th April, Peicai Secondary School had the pleasure of welcoming students
and staff from Caritas Wu Cheng Chung College (CWCC), Hong Kong. This meaningful
visit was part of our commitment to nurturing a global outlook and providing
authentic opportunities for cultural exchange and learning beyond the classroom,
and the Peicai OSEP team had visited CWCC back in November 2024.</p>
<p>The visiting group spent a full day at our school, touring our school
campus and participating in a variety of engaging workshops. CWCC students
were warmly received by our Peicai buddies at the foyer in the morning.
It was a meaningful reunion and a wonderful opportunity for the students
to reconnect with their buddies and strengthen the bonds of friendship.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, students enjoyed a mix of sports and arts activities
â€” from a spirited Ultimate Frisbee game; to creating their own personalised
keychains. These hands-on sessions encouraged teamwork, creativity, and
cultural exchange.</p>
