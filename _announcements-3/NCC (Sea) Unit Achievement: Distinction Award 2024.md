<h4>NCC (Sea) Unit Achievement: Distinction Award 2024</h4>
<p>We are delighted to announce that our school's NCC (Sea) Unit has achieved
the Distinction Award in the Unit Recognition (UR) assessment for 2024.
This prestigious accolade reflects the outstanding commitment and achievements
of our cadets and teacher officers throughout the year.</p>
<p>Our unit demonstrated excellence across various assessment criteria, including
unit administration, training management, and cadet leadership development.
The cadets showed remarkable proficiency in seamanship, navigation, and
maritime knowledge whilst maintaining high standards in foot drills and
physical training.</p>
<p>Key achievements this year included:</p>

with a strong maritime interest and robust character.</p>
