<p>Peicai Secondary School proudly joined the nationwide <strong>Purple Parade movement</strong> in
support of inclusion and people with special needs. This year’s celebrations
centred around a lively <strong>Purple Parade Booth</strong>, which became
a hub of learning, reflection and joy for both students and staff.</p>
<p>Students took part in an <strong>Inclusivity Quiz</strong> to learn more
about different abilities and engaged in <strong>Simulation Games organised by Secondary 1IN</strong> that
allowed them to experience the challenges faced by persons with disabilities.
They also enjoyed the <strong>Gachapon corner</strong>, earning prizes for
completing inclusion-themed activities and shared their personal pledges
on the <strong>Pledge Board</strong>, committing to make Peicai a more inclusive
community.</p>
<p>Staff were also encouraged to <strong>wear purple</strong> in solidarity,
symbolising support for inclusion and unity. They gathered in the staff
pantry to enjoy <strong>coffee from Foreword Coffee</strong>, a social enterprise
that empowers persons with disabilities, and <strong>cookies from Meta Café</strong>,
while learning more about inclusive employment.</p>
<p>The event brought the whole Peicai family together in a vibrant show of
empathy, respect and understanding — a reminder that inclusion begins with
awareness, kindness, and celebrating the unique strengths in everyone.</p>
