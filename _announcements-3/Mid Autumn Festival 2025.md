<p>On 17 October (Friday), Peicai staff, parents and students came together
to make merry for our 3rd annual Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration cum PSG
Family Day. This year, the inaugural Under 7s Best-Dressed Competition
brought the audience lots of delight as eight adorable young contestants
took the stage with their Mid-Autumn themed costumes. Following a delicious
dinner, guests took part in station activities of mooncake-making, arts
and crafts and pomelo peeling, all while enjoying the traditional fringe
activities set up by the Mother Tongue Department. Finally, the night ended
with a Moon Appreciation Walk around the school to spot as many "Moons"
and "Rabbits" as possible. It was truly a heartwarming night to remember!</p>
