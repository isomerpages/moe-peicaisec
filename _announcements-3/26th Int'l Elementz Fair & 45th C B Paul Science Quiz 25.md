<p>The school is proud to celebrate the outstanding achievements of our students
at two distinguished science competitions — the 26<sup>th</sup> International
Elementz Fair and the C.B. Paul Science Quiz 2025.</p>
<p>At the 26<sup>th</sup> International Elementz Fair, two teams represented
the school at this prestigious event, hosted by Anderson Serangoon Junior
College. This provides a valuable platform for students to showcase their
original research projects to both local and international audiences.</p>
