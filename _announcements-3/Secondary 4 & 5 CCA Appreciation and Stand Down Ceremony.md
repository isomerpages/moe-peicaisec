<p>On 4 April 2025, the graduating cohort of Secondary 4 and 5 students gathered
for a meaningful and heartfelt CCA Appreciation and Stand Down Ceremony,
marking the end of a significant chapter in their school journey. With
the theme ‘Adieu’, the event symbolised a fond farewell - celebrating the
achievements, friendships, and memories forged over the past four to five
years.</p>
<p>The ceremony began on a high note with a surprise video montage, lovingly
curated and orchestrated by our very own CCA leaders. The video was a nostalgic
walk down memory lane, capturing the spirit, laughter, and hard work behind
each CCA’s journey.</p>
<p>A flag walk-in ceremony followed, setting the tone for a dignified and
proud moment for all. One of the most solemn highlights was the Uniformed
Groups Passing Out Parade, presided over by our Vice Principal, Ms Chung.
This final salute was a stirring tribute to the dedication and discipline
of our UG cadets.</p>
<p>Selected CCA leaders also took to the stage to lead the cohort in reciting
the CCA Aspiration Statement, as well as to share heartfelt speeches -
a blend of gratitude, reflection, and encouragement for their juniors to
carry the torch forward. Their words resonated deeply with the audience,
reflecting the passion and leadership they’ve shown over the years.</p>
<p>The celebration concluded with a buffet treat and individual CCA farewell
sessions, where juniors and teachers expressed their appreciation in warm
and creative ways - from heartfelt gifts to fun games and meaningful activities.</p>
<p>We extend our deepest thanks to the graduating cohort for their unwavering
contributions, resilience, and commitment to their CCAs. Your legacy will
inspire generations to come. We wish you all the best for your upcoming
National Examinations!</p>
