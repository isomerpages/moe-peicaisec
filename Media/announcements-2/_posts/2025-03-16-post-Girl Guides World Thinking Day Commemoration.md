<p><strong>Peicai Girl Guides</strong>
</p>
<p>On February 22nd, schools across the world celebrate World Thinking Day,
a special occasion when Girl Guides and Brownies come together to honour
international friendship and raise awareness on issues affecting girls
and young women.</p>
<p>The Theme for World Thinking Day this year is Our Story. Reflecting on
the symbolism and values of our Movement, “Our Story” explores what it
has meant to be a Girl Guide over the years. This includes exploring how
Girl Guides can understand the past in the world today, while supporting
girls around the world to feel confident, care about their world and develop
the skills needed to make a difference.</p>
<p>This year, Brownies and Girl Guides gathered at the Singapore Expo to
celebrate World Thinking Day (WTD). This special occasion celebrates our
global movement, strengthens international friendships, and shares the
inspiring stories of our Guiding community. We were also honoured to have
Ms. Candela Gonzalez, Chair of the World Board, WAGGGS, as our Guest of
Honour at the special occasion.</p>
<p>In our school, the Girl Guides marked World Thinking Day during the morning
assembly by watching an inspiring video message from Dr. Seetha Subbiah,
the President of Girl Guides Singapore. This observance was a powerful
reminder for everyone to reflect on their role in creating a more inclusive
and just world for girls and young women.</p>
