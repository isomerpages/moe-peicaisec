<h4><strong>Goals &amp; Objectives</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Debate Society provides students with a dynamic platform to develop
their critical thinking, persuasive communication, and collaborative skills
through a range of intellectually stimulating experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From friendly debate matches with schools such as Whitley Secondary and
Montfort Secondary to the Julia Gabriel Debating Workshop, members refine
their ability to construct logical arguments, think on their feet, and
speak with confidence and clarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their participation in the Moot Parliament Programme at Parliament House
further deepens their understanding of governance and policymaking, nurturing
informed and engaged citizens who appreciate the complexities of public
discourse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Debate Society also proudly represents the school in prestigious competitions
such as the Singapore International Schools Debating Championship, Raffles
Institution Under-14s Debating Championship, and the National Public Speaking
Competition 2025, where students pit their skills against some of the best
young orators in the nation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through these varied opportunities, our debaters grow into articulate,
confident, and discerning thinkers ready to engage meaningfully with the
world around them.</p>
</li>
