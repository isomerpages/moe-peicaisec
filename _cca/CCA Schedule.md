<p></p><p align="justify">CCAs are a key component of studentsâ€™ holistic education. Through CCAs, students discover their interests and talents. CCAs also provide platforms for students to develop their character, learn values, social emotional competencies, and other relevant skills to prepare them for future challenges.</p>
<p></p><p align="justify">CCAs bring students from diverse backgrounds together. By learning and interacting with one another, students develop friendships and deepen their sense of belonging to the school and community. CCA is compulsory for all secondary school students. </p>
