<h4><strong>Goals &amp; Objectives</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The S6 Center-Based CCA for Table Tennis is an MOE initiative where a
few schools come together to form a CCA to provide a wider variety of choices,
promote social mixing and pool funding and resources to promote more sports
for competition and for play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formed in 2024 with Bartley Secondary, Peicai Secondary, St Gab’s Secondary
and Yuying Secondary, the CCA aims to expand their numbers to have an even
stronger representation in 2026 and beyond at National Schools Games and
equivalent regional competitions where available.</p>
