<h4><strong>Basketball Boys</strong></h4>
<p><p align="justify">The Peicai Basketball Team (PCSS) has evolved over the years. Currently we have started a recreational team to complement the school team. This is to cater to the needs of students who wish to join Basketball not just for competition but to keep fit, and also for those who like to have a second CCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><p align="justify">Through the training programme, we inculcate positive school values, fair play and sportsmanship to develop Peicaians of Character. We are happy that in 2016, our Peicai Basketball Team won the Fair Play Award in the South Zone competitions for showing respect to our opponents and committing the least number of fouls in the competition.</p>
<p><p align="justify">Other than our usual trainings, we also take part in friendly matches with other schools and other external competitions to keep students active and engaged.&nbsp;</p>
