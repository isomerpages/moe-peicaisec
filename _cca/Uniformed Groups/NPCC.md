<p></p><p align="justify">Peicai’s NPCC firmly believes in development of character, leadership and resilience. Training has evolved from just drills to more structured and interesting training programmes. Through a myriad of activities, values such as discipline, loyalty, integrity, resourcefulness, tenacity and civic-consciousness are inculcated to develop members into Caring and Responsible Citizens.
</p><p><b>Drills:</b><br>Drills are an essential part of any uniformed group as they help to instill discipline within cadets and promote camaraderie among them.<br><b>Campcraft:</b><br>The outdoor component of NPCC, which consist of Tent-pitching, pegging, knot and lashings and how build a flagstaff.<br><b>Unit Camp:</b>Our annual camp is a milestone for all cadets, with the outdoor cooking being one of the most memorable experiences!<br><b>Police Knowledge:</b>Policing is an important part of NPCC. We learn skills such as Crime Scene Investigation (CSI), Police Procedures, Road Safety and many more.<br><b>.22 Classification Shoot</b><br>Revolver shooting is among one of the many interesting activities that the National Police Cadet Corps exposes to their cadets. The aims of revolver shooting are to train cadets’ determination, will to excel and instil a greater sense of discipline, as well as to give cadets a better understanding of the police duties in the Singapore Police Force.<br><b>Camp Resilience:</b><br>In achieving its objectives in building resilience among its campers, Camp Resilience encourages outdoor activities, ranging from obstacle courses to sea activities, to allow the campers to enjoy an outgoing experience during their stays. Essentially, the obstacle courses at Camp Resilience mainly refers to the High Ropes Challenge, which are distributed between Kg Noordin and Kg Bahru.<br><b>Crime Scene Investigation:</b><br>Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) is a form of forensic science which supports investigation, leading the authorities or the police to the facts behind an incident or a crime scene. In this course we teach our cadets what they can do to help solve a crime. Students are introduced to fingerprints, blood splatter patterns, crime scene photography, and ways to protect the integrity of the scene.</p>
