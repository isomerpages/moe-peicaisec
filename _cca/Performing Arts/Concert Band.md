<p></p><p align="justify">Our Band’s motto is “One Band, One Family, One Sound”. Founded in 1984, Peicai Concert Band is a very unique Co-Curricular Activity as most of our Band members started off without music background. Our repertoire includes pieces from classical music to pop music. Our Band members are given the platform to develop teamwork and a strong sense  of musicality during our annual Band workshop and school exchange programme.<br><br>Our teachers organise outings and Band exchange programmes to widen our repertoire of learning and provide a platform for us to have fun together. As such, we not only learn, create and appreciate music but we are also given opportunityies to develop our sense of responsibility, interpersonal skills and leadership skills through the CCA.<br><br>We also took part in the school audio recording project and collaborated with students from other CCA groups. It is definitely a challenging yet fulfilling experience for all the students who were involved in this meaningful project as all the school values ; perseverance, respect and empathy were being displayed throughout the preparation journey.
