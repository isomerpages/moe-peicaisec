<h4><strong>Concert Band SYF Distinction</strong></h4>
<p>We are happy to announce that our very own Peicai Concert Band was awarded
a <strong>DISTINCTION</strong> at the recent SYF Arts Presentation. This
is the first time ever since the 20-year history of Concert Band’s inception.</p>
<p>This achievement is the result of months of rigorous preparation and steadfast
commitment from our students. Their dedication was especially evident during
the band intensive sessions, where they devoted significant time to perfect
their pieces. In this competition, the band performed two technically and
musically demanding pieces:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Overture No. 1 by Kelly Tang (Set Piece)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Witch and The Saint by Steven Reineke (Choice Piece)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The students rose admirably to the occasion, demonstrating not only technical
excellence but also maturity, perseverance and teamwork throughout the
rehearsals and performance. This Distinction is a significant milestone
for our Concert Band, and we hope it will serve as both recognition of
our students’ efforts and inspiration for future cohorts.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for making this achievement possible and our heartiest
congratulations goes to our Concert Band on this remarkable milestone!</p>

<p>Our Band’s motto is “One Band, One Family, One Sound”. Founded in 1984,
Peicai Concert Band is a very unique Co-Curricular Activity as most of
our Band members started off without music background. Our repertoire includes
pieces from classical music to pop music. Our Band members are given the
platform to develop teamwork and a strong sense of musicality during our
annual Band workshop and school exchange programme.
<br>
<br>Our teachers organise outings and Band exchange programmes to widen our
repertoire of learning and provide a platform for us to have fun together.
As such, we not only learn, create and appreciate music but we are also
given opportunityies to develop our sense of responsibility, interpersonal
skills and leadership skills through the CCA.
<br>
<br>We also took part in the school audio recording project and collaborated
with students from other CCA groups. It is definitely a challenging yet
fulfilling experience for all the students who were involved in this meaningful
project as all the school values ; perseverance, respect and empathy were
being displayed throughout the preparation journey.</p>
