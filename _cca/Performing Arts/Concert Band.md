<h4>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation – Concert Band Distinction Award</h4>
<p>We are proud to share that our school’s Concert Band has achieved a <strong><em>Distinction</em></strong> in
the recent Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation – marking a
historic milestone as the first time in 20 years the band has reached this
level of excellence.</p>
<p>Under the baton of our dedicated conductor – Mr Erik Tan, the band delivered
a powerful and moving performance of <em>Overture No. 1</em> by Kelly Tang
and <em>The Witch and The Saint</em> by Steven Reineke. Both works demanded
a high level of technical precision, musical sensitivity and ensemble coordination,
all of which were delivered with commendable professionalism and artistry
by our students.</p>
<p>This outstanding achievement is the result of months of unwavering commitment,
especially during the band intensive sessions. Our students pushed through
long rehearsals, overcame personal and collective challenges, and grew
not only as musicians but as a united ensemble. Their perseverance, teamwork
and passion for music have truly paid off.</p>
<p>We celebrate this well-deserved distinction and applaud every member of
the band for their hard work and dedication. This momentous success is
a testament to what can be achieved through resilience and hard work, and
it will undoubtedly inspire future generations of band members to dream
big.</p>

<p>Our Band’s motto is “One Band, One Family, One Sound”. Founded in 1984,
Peicai Concert Band is a very unique Co-Curricular Activity as most of
our Band members started off without music background. Our repertoire includes
pieces from classical music to pop music. Our Band members are given the
platform to develop teamwork and a strong sense of musicality during our
annual Band workshop and school exchange programme.
<br>
<br>Our teachers organise outings and Band exchange programmes to widen our
repertoire of learning and provide a platform for us to have fun together.
As such, we not only learn, create and appreciate music but we are also
given opportunityies to develop our sense of responsibility, interpersonal
skills and leadership skills through the CCA.
<br>
<br>We also took part in the school audio recording project and collaborated
with students from other CCA groups. It is definitely a challenging yet
fulfilling experience for all the students who were involved in this meaningful
project as all the school values ; perseverance, respect and empathy were
being displayed throughout the preparation journey.</p>
