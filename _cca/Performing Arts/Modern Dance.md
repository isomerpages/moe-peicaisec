<p>PCSS Modern Dance Club&nbsp;seeks to develop the passion for dancing in students by providing them with opportunities to showcase their talents through external competitions as well as in house performance culminating to the bi-annual Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.<br /></p>
<p>It specialises in contemporary dance which incorporates elements from many styles of dance such as classical, ballet and jazz. During dance trainings, we focus on mastering strong and controlled legwork of ballet, floor work,&nbsp;fall and recovery and other techniques.</p>
