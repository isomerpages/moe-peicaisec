<p>Lions Club of Nanyang has been a supportive partner of Peicai with the aim to nurture committed learners and compassionate leaders. Key programmes that have been implemented and sustained over the years through a segmented approach include Project Heart@Peicai as well as Chinese New Year celebrations where Peicaians contribute self designed hampers to the less privileged community from the Lion Befrienders Home for the Aged.</p>
