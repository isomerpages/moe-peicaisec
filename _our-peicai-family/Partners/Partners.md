<h4><strong>Partnerships with Alumni</strong></h4>
<p>Ensuring and facilitating the continual bonding of our alumni is one of the objectives of the Peicai Alumni. Our alumni serve as volunteer organisers who plan and conduct activities to connect the past and present batch of students to strengthen our school spirit. Some of these activities include organising Prom Night for our Secondary Four and Five graduates annually and assisting as volunteer coaches and trainers in co-curricular activity (CCA) groups. In addition, they also return to share their personal success stories to inspire current students towards their goals and provide academic consultation for those who need it during our Project Home Run (Night Study) Programme.</p>
<h4><strong>Partnerships with External Organisations</strong></h4>
<p>We have established partnerships with two organisations &ndash; Rotary Club of Changi and Lions Befrienders Service Association (Singapore) &ndash; with an aim to nurture committed learners and compassionate leaders. Key programmes that have been implemented and sustained over the years through a segmented approach include Project Heart@Peicai with Lions Befrienders as well as the Tan Leong Teck Scholarship Award for Interactors by the Rotary Club of Changi. This year we will expanding our collaboration to include job attachments/job shadowing as well as career talks for our students.</p>
