<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Principal’s Welcome Letter for Secondary One Cohort (2024)</u></strong></p>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians of Secondary One Students</p>
<p><strong>1 </strong>Congratulations on your child’s/ward’s successful completion of the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) as well as on your child’s/ward’s admission to Peicai Secondary School (PCSS)!</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> We are happy to extend a very warm welcome to the students and parents of the Secondary One cohort for 2024.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> As announced by the Ministry of Education (MOE), students do not need to report to their posted secondary schools after receiving their S1 Posting Results. Instead, students should refer to their posted schools' websites for the registration details.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> For our school, you would see a tab titled “<strong>Secondary One Registration 2024</strong>” on the main page of our school website where you would be able to access the relevant information.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> You can also expect to receive additional instructions from the school via Parents Gateway by 20 December 2023 (Wed) 5pm.</p>
<p><strong>6</strong> All parents will be informed of the Secondary One Form Class allocation as well as the names and email addresses of the Form Teachers for their child via Parents Gateway (PG) by 5pm on 29 December 2023 (Fri).</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>We encourage all parents to be a member of the school’s Parent Support Group as it would instantly connect you with a number of parents with whom you would be able to interact and share ideas as well as thoughts on how you could further support your child in his/her journey as a teenager. You can indicate your interest to join the Parent Support Group via the&nbsp;<em>Secondary One Registration Form 2024 </em>&nbsp;to be sent via Parents Gateway.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong> Please check our school website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.peicaisec.moe.edu.sg/">https://www.peicaisec.moe.edu.sg/</a>&nbsp;for regular updates and announcements. Should you have any queries on Secondary One matters, you may contact Mr Edwin Kwek, HOD/Science overseeing Secondary One Registration matters, at kwek_swee_hee_edwin@moe.edu.sg or email the school at peicai_ss@moe.edu.sg.</p>
<p><strong>9</strong> I look forward to your strong support in providing an enriching and rewarding educational journey for all our students.</p>
<p>I would also like to take this opportunity to wish you and your family members a very Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br>Mr Michael Muhunthan<br>Principal</p>
