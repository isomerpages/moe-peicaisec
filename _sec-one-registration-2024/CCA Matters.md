<p>CCAs are an integral part of a student’s school life and holistic development.
It is compulsory for all students to have at least one CCA.</p>
<p>The school will be organising a CCA Open House to help students and parents
make a well-considered decision on their choice of CCA.</p>
<p>All Secondary One students would be able to indicate their three preferred
CCA options via an online option form. The link details will be sent via
PG at a later date.</p>

the list of CCAs offered in the school as well as the CCA schedules. Do
note that in 2024, a joint-cluster schools initiative CCA for Table Tennis
(Boys) will also be offered in Peicai Secondary School at limited availability.
More details will be shared at the CCA Open House.</p>
