<p>CCAs are an integral part of a student’s school life and holistic development. It is compulsory for all students to have at least one CCA.</p><p>The school will be organising a CCA Open House to help students and parents make a well-considered decision on their choice of CCA.</p><p>All Secondary One students would be able to indicate their three preferred CCA options via an online option form. The link details will be sent via PG at a later date.</p><p>Please click on the link <a href="https://www.peicaisec.moe.edu.sg/cca/ccas/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.peicaisec.moe.edu.sg/cca/ccas/</a> for the list of CCAs offered in the school as well as the CCA schedules.
