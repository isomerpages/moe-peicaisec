<p>If your child/ward is eligible to offer certain subjects at a more demanding level, you would complete the section on <em>Offer to Take Subjects at a more demanding </em>level in the <em>Secondary One Registration Form 2024 </em>via PG or email for those not yet on-board PG <strong>by 5pm on 20 December 2023 (Wed).</strong></p><p>You will need to complete the section on <em>Offer to Take Subjects at a more demanding </em>level in the <em>Secondary One Registration Form 2024 </em>via PG or email for those have not onboarded PG <strong>by 5pm on 22 December 2023 (Fri).</strong></p><p>If the consent is not submitted by <strong>22 December 2023 (Fri</strong>) <strong>5pm</strong>, the school will take it that you are rejecting the offer to take the subject at a more demanding level. The school will not be able to accept late submissions due to deployment and timetabling which need to be done in advance. We seek your understanding on this.</p><p>Once the decision to take a subject at a more demanding level is made and submitted via PG or email, no request for change will be considered as it will affect class allocation. We also seek your understanding on this.</p><p>Students are advised not to purchase the textbooks until they have made a decision whether to accept or reject the SBB offer. Do note that textbooks must be in acceptable condition for any exchange from the bookshop vendor.</p><p>For more information about Subject-Based Banding, please click the link here <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/full-subject-based-banding/secondary-school-experience.html</a>.</p><p>Should you have any further queries on Subject-Based Banding, you could contact Mr Edwin Kwek (Head of Department, Science), via email at <a href="mailto:tham_peck_fun@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">kwek_swee_hee_edwin@moe.edu.sg</a>.</p>
