<p>Students in the N(A) and N(T) courses who are eligible to offer certain subjects at a more<br>demanding level will receive a letter of offer via PG&nbsp;<a name="_Hlk122022726"></a>or email for those not yet on board PG&nbsp;<strong>by</strong><br><strong>noon on 23 December 2022 (Fri).</strong></p>
<p>Parents can accept the offer by giving consent via PG or return the signed form via email for those&nbsp;<br>not yet on board PG&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>27 December 2022</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(Tues).</strong></p>
<p>If the consent is not submitted by&nbsp;<strong>27 December 2022 (Tues</strong>), the school will take it that you are rejecting the offer to take the subject at a more demanding level. The school will not be able to&nbsp;<br>accept late submissions due to deployment and timetabling which need to be done in advance.&nbsp;<br>We seek your understanding on this.</p>
<p>Once the decision to take a subject at a more demanding level is made and submitted via PG or&nbsp;<br>email, no request for change will be considered as it will affect class allocation. We also seek your&nbsp;<br>understanding on this.</p>
<p>Students are advised not to purchase the textbooks until they have made a decision whether to&nbsp;<br>accept or reject the SBB offer. Do note that textbooks must be in acceptable condition for any&nbsp;<br>exchange from the bookshop vendor.</p>
