<p><u>Introduction</u></p><p>MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) in March 2020 for all schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy.</p><p>One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD).</p><p><u>PLDs in Teaching and Learning</u></p><p>Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) have tremendous potential to transform the learning environment as it enables teachers and students to harness technology for greater effectiveness in teaching and learning. The use of the PLDs for teaching and learning will also support the development of digital literacies in our students as well as develop them as future ready self-directed and collaborative learners.</p><p><u>Choice of PLD in Peicai Secondary School</u></p><p>The school is using the <strong>Apple iPad 10.2” 9th Gen (64 GB) </strong>as its choice for the PLD for all students. The device bundle includes a 3-year warranty, 3-year insurance, a 1st Gen Apple Pencil, and a Logitech keyboard with cover.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 25%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/pld.png"></div><p>Please note that parents/guardians do not have the option to select a different PLD or accessory for school purchase.
