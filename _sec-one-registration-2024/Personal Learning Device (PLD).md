<p><u>Introduction</u></p>
<p>MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) in March 2020 for our schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy.</p>
<p>One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD).</p>
<p><u>PLDs in Teaching and Learning</u></p>
<p>Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) have tremendous potential to transform the learning environment as it enables teachers and students to harness technology for greater effectiveness in teaching and learning. The use of the personal learning devices for teaching and learning will also support the development of digital literacies in our students as well as develop them as future ready self-directed and collaborative learners.</p>
<p><u>Choice of PLD in Peicai Secondary</u></p>
<p>PCSS is using the&nbsp;<strong>Apple iPad 10.2” 9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Gen&nbsp;</strong>as its choice for the PLD for all students. The device bundle includes a 3-year warranty, 3-year insurance, a 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Gen Apple Pencil, and a Logitech keyboard with cover.</p>
