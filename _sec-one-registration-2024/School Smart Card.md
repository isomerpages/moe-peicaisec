<p>Students entering Secondary One in January 2023 will be issued with a new Secondary level&nbsp;<br>School Smart Card (SSC). The delivery dates for the SSCs will be made known in due course.</p>
<p>While Secondary One students are waiting for their Secondary level SSCs to be ready, they&nbsp;<br>can continue to use their Primary level SSCs for concessionary travel till end April 2023. Students&nbsp;<br>can still purchase the Bus Concession Pass (BCP) using their Primary level SSCs but they&nbsp;would need to purchase the BCP for Secondary School students.</p>
