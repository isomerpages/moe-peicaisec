<h4><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>In Peicai Secondary School, we aim to achieve the following through the
Computer Applications (CPA) subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Promotes digital literacy. CPA prepares students to be technologically
adept and to contribute effectively in a society that is increasingly driven
by ICT. Students learn to be responsible, confident and creative users
of technology who can participate and thrive in a digital world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engages students and prepares them for future studies. The hands-on and
interactive nature of the subject effectively engages students in their
learning. Through engaged learning, students are equipped with a wide range
of necessary ICT skills that prepare them to meet the demands of other
subjects in secondary school and at post-secondary institutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supports the development of 21st Century Competencies (21CC). Through
CPA, students acquire skills such as critical thinking, information processing
and effective communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develops computational thinking skills. Since 2012, the CPA syllabus has
included programming where students learn basic computational thinking
skills such as algorithmic thinking and decomposition through creating
animations and games.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From 2024 onwards, Computer Applications (CPA) which is currently only
available for the Normal Technical (NT) stream will be gradually phased
out. It will be replaced with G1, G2 and G3 Computing from 2026, and available
as an elective subject to all Upper Secondary students. This strategic
shift is part of a national initiative to enhance technological proficiency
across the student body. To lay the foundation, Lower Secondary students
will acquire basic digital skills through integrated tasks within various
subjects and programme. The tiered G1/G2/G3 Computing are designed to foster
a deeper interest and higher competency in computing disciplines among
those who wish to pursue them.</p>
<h4><strong>Department Programme/Highlights</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The Animation and Game Making (AGM) Competition is an annual competition,
for Secondary school students offering the CPA subject, organised by the
Computer Education Unit of Curriculum Planning and Development Division
(CPDD).</p>
<p>The objectives of the AGM Competition are to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>provide a platform to showcase students’ work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop students’ interest in media design; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hone students’ communication and presentation skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>This competition is held in conjunction with the school-based course projects
for the CPA subject at Secondary 2 and Secondary 3 levels. Students will
develop an animation or game based on the respective theme provided for
the course projects. Upon completion of the projects, CPA subject teachers
will select the best piece of work to be submitted for the competition.</p>
