<p style="text-align: center;">Vision:&nbsp;Critical Minds, Compassionate Hearts</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Mission:&nbsp;To engage and interest students to acquire scientific knowledge, skills and attitudes to be effective citizens in an innovation-driven future economy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Framework:&nbsp;Science for Life and Society</p>
<p>The Lower Secondary Science (LSS) Curriculum helps students obtain baseline scientific literacy for basic citizenry, and to equip students with a strong foundation to support their further studies. In Peicai, LSS continues the General Science emphasis of Primary Science before students pursue the disciplinary subjects of Physics, Chemistry and Biology at Secondary 3, 4 and/or 5. This approach in LSS supports students in making connections across disciplines and solving interdisciplinary problems.</p>
<p>The aims of the Lower Secondary Science syllabuses are to:</p>
<p>A. Cultivate students&rsquo; appreciation of Science as a collective human endeavor to understand the natural world, and as a way of thinking rather than just a body of facts.</p>
<p>B. Inspire students to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in science-related issues that concern their lives, the society and the environment.</p>
<p>C. Help students to develop fundamentals that are integral to scientific inquiry and innovation, including problem-seeking and problem-solving.</p>

<p>The Peicai Science Department anchors its Teaching and Learning on the nation-wide Science Curriculum framework &lsquo;Science for Life and Society&rsquo;. Through this framework, we want our students to be scientifically literate, so that they can make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their daily lives. On top of that, we also want to enable students to thrive and achieve success at work in our innovation-driven future economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Across all the levels and streams, Peicai Science Teachers plan Science lessons revolving around practical and experimentation, as our sole belief is that students learn and understand scientific concepts better through the hands-on approach. Students work in groups in the Science laboratories, classrooms and even outdoor areas to solve real life problems. Teachers play the important role of facilitators in such activities, ensuring that students ask questions and engage in meaningful scientific dialogue.</p>
<p>Also, over the 4 to 5 years of Science education in Peicai, relevant science enrichment programmes are also planned for all Peicai students according to the level appropriate focus shown below:</p>

<p>Through these carefully planned enrichment programmes, we put our students through a more enriching curriculum in Peicai, where they are given the opportunities to learn more beyond the traditional classroom setting.</p>
