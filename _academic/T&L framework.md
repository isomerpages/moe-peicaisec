<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p align="justify">At Peicai Secondary School, we have designed our Teaching and Learning (T&amp;L) framework to be easily understood and visualised, much like a Ferris Wheel. The wheel has three main compartments or "carriers". These represent the core stages of our teaching considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design: Planning the learning experiences and activities;</li>
<li>Delivery: Enacting the lessons; and</li>
<li>Assessment and Feedback: Gauging students' understanding and providing feedback for improvement.</li></ul>
<p align="justify">Additionally, there's a fourth element, "Positive Classroom Culture". Think of this as a connector that links the three compartments, ensuring a supportive and nurturing learning environment for every student.</p>
<p align="justify">At the very centre of the <i>Ferris Wheel</i> is our main goal - the desired outcomes of education, or simply put, what we want our students to achieve. This goal, combined with the teaching considerations (the three carriers and the connector) is grounded in our fundamental belief and motivation for education.</p>
