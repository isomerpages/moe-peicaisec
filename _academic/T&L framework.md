<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p align="justify">At Peicai Secondary School, we have designed our Teaching and Learning (T&amp;L) framework to be easily understood and visualised, much like a Ferris Wheel. The wheel has three main compartments or "carriers". These represent the core stages of our teaching considerations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Design: Planning the learning experiences and activities;</li>
	<li>Delivery: Enacting the lessons; and</li>
	<li>Assessment and Feedback: Gauging students' understanding and providing feedback for improvement.</li></ul>
