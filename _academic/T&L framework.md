<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p align="justify">At Peicai Secondary School, we have designed our Teaching and Learning (T&amp;L) framework to be easily understood and visualised, much like a Ferris Wheel. The wheel has three main compartments or "carriers". These represent the core stages of our teaching considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design: Planning the learning experiences and activities;</li>
<li>Delivery: Enacting the lessons; and</li>
<li>Assessment and Feedback: Gauging students' understanding and providing feedback for improvement.</li></ul>
<p align="justify">Additionally, there's a fourth element, "Positive Classroom Culture". Think of this as a connector that links the three compartments, ensuring a supportive and nurturing learning environment for every student.</p>
<p align="justify">At the very centre of the <i>Ferris Wheel</i> is our main goal - the desired outcomes of education, or simply put, what we want our students to achieve. This goal, combined with the teaching considerations (the three carriers and the connector) is grounded in our fundamental belief and motivation for education.</p>

<p><b>WHAT (Outcomes)</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Preparing for the Future:</b> At Peicai Secondary School, our ultimate goal is to shape students into individuals who are well-prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the future. Rooted in a strong national identity, they will be equipped with the skills and knowledge to navigate an ever-globalising world. Through our educational approach, we aim to empower them to lead fulfilling lives, actively contribute to society, and fervently pursue their aspirations and dreams.</p>
