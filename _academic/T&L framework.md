<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p align="justify">At Peicai Secondary School, we have designed our Teaching and Learning (T&amp;L) framework to be easily understood and visualised, much like a Ferris Wheel. The wheel has three main compartments or "carriers". These represent the core stages of our teaching considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design: Planning the learning experiences and activities;</li>
<li>Delivery: Enacting the lessons; and</li>
<li>Assessment and Feedback: Gauging students' understanding and providing feedback for improvement.</li></ul>
<p align="justify">Additionally, there's a fourth element, "Positive Classroom Culture". Think of this as a connector that links the three compartments, ensuring a supportive and nurturing learning environment for every student.</p>
<p align="justify">At the very centre of the <i>Ferris Wheel</i> is our main goal - the desired outcomes of education, or simply put, what we want our students to achieve. This goal, combined with the teaching considerations (the three carriers and the connector) is grounded in our fundamental belief and motivation for education.</p>

<p><b>WHAT (Outcomes)</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Preparing for the Future:</b> At Peicai Secondary School, our ultimate goal is to shape students into individuals who are well-prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the future. Rooted in a strong national identity, they will be equipped with the skills and knowledge to navigate an ever-globalising world. Through our educational approach, we aim to empower them to lead fulfilling lives, actively contribute to society, and fervently pursue their aspirations and dreams.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>21st Century Competencies (21CC):</b> An integral part of our curriculum focuses on MOE’s 21CC. These competencies are not just academic in nature but are foundational values and skills critical for holistic growth. We emphasise core values such as <b>respect, responsibility, resilience, integrity, care, and harmony </b>— pillars that form the bedrock of our societal and national ethos. Furthermore, we ensure that every Peicaian acquires pivotal socio-emotional skills tailored for today's interconnected world. These include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Civic, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Literacy:</b>Understanding one's role and responsibilities in society, and appreciating global perspectives and navigating diverse cultures.</li>
	<li><b>Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking:</b>  Approaching challenges adaptively with creativity and a problem-solving mindset.</li>
	<li><b>Communication, Collaboration, and Information Skills:</b>Effectively interacting, working in teams, and harnessing information in the digital age.</li></ul>

<p><b>WHY (Motivation)</b></p>
<p align="justify">At the core of our educational ethos at Peicai Secondary School, we prioritise each student's individual needs and aspirations, making them central to our educational decisions.</p>
<p align="justify">Our conviction is firm: every Peicaian possesses a zeal to learn and has the potential to make significant contributions and excel in various avenues. This philosophy aligns with the Ministry of Education (MOE)’s initiative to cultivate a multitude of talents and to offer diverse pathways, ensuring every child has the opportunity to thrive and succeed, irrespective of their background or starting point.</p>
<p align="justify">At Peicai, we are committed to delivering enriching and dynamic learning experiences. These experiences aim to instill a profound sense of purpose and to unlock the fullest potential in every Peicaian. In doing so, we echo our school’s mission: enabling students to Discover their unique purpose in learning and life, Develop holistically in academic prowess and character, and Excel in areas where their strengths, passions, and interests converge.</p>
<p align="justify">All these core tenets culminate in the "Peicai Experience" – an educational journey where each student is not merely a passive receiver but an enthusiastic contributor to their learning journey.</p>
