<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4><p></p><p>In December 2020, MOE introduced Blended Learning (BL) as a key part of the schooling experience for our students. Students will learn what is prescribed by the curriculum through a mix of home-based and in-school activities, and leverage both online and offline approaches to learning. One key aspect of the BL approach is the integration of Home-based Learning (HBL) days as a regular feature of the schooling experience to complement teaching and learning in schools.</p><p></p><p>Blended Learning is supported by the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP), under which all secondary students will own a personal learning device (PLD)</p><h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4><p></p><p>At Peicai Secondary School, teachers design engaging Blended Learning experiences to:<br>1. Nurture self-directed and independent learners, and;<br>2. Develop passionate and intrinsically motivated learners.</p><p></p><p>Through both online and offline approaches to learning, we aim to provide students with opportunities to <strong>learn at their own pace</strong>&nbsp;and be empowered to&nbsp;<strong>take charge of their learning</strong>&nbsp;for core curriculum as well as their interests beyond the syllabus.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Home-based Learning (HBL) Days</strong></h4><p></p><p>HBL days are scheduled on some odd Wednesdays to complement teaching and learning in school.</p><p><strong>HBL Days for 2024</strong></p><p></p><p>Sec 1 to Sec 3:</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Term 1</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Term 2</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Term 3</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Term 4</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>31 Jan (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>20 Mar (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>10 Jul (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>16 Oct (Wed)</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>28 Feb (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>17 Apr (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>23 Jul (Tue)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>&nbsp;15 May (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>24 Jul (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>25 Jul (Thu)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Sec 4/5:</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Term 1</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Term 2</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Term 3</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>31 Jan (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>20 Mar (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>10 Jul (Wed)</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>17 Apr (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>23 Jul (Tue)</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>15 May (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>24 Jul (Wed)</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>25 Jul (Thu)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>On HBL days, students will have asynchronous learning with lesson resources assigned to students via &nbsp;<a href="https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Student Learning Space</a>.&nbsp;Students will also have Morning Check-in (using Zoom) on every first HBL of the month with their Form Teachers and classmates where they will discuss about learning dispositions and attitudes. Time is also set aside for Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) for students to pursue learning in areas of their interests and learn outside of the curriculum.
