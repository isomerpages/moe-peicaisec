<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p>In December 2020, MOE introduced Blended Learning (BL) as a key part of the schooling experience for our students.&nbsp;Students will learn what is prescribed by the curriculum through a mix of home-based and in-school activities, and leverage both online and offline approaches to learning.&nbsp;One key aspect of the BL approach is the integration of Home-based Learning (HBL) days as a regular feature of the schooling experience to complement teaching and learning in schools.</p>
<p>Blended Learning is supported by the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) that was announced earlier in 2020, which will ensure that all secondary students will own a personal learning device (PLD) by end-2021.</p>
