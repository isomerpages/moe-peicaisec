<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p><p align="justify">In December 2020, MOE introduced Blended Learning (BL) as a key part of the schooling experience for our students. Students will learn what is prescribed by the curriculum through a mix of home-based and in-school activities, and leverage both online and offline approaches to learning. One key aspect of the BL approach is the integration of Home-based Learning (HBL) days as a regular feature of the schooling experience to complement teaching and learning in schools.</p>
<p><p align="justify">Blended Learning is supported by the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP), under which all secondary students will own a personal learning device (PLD) </p>
<h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4>
<p><p align="justify">At Peicai Secondary School, teachers design engaging Blended Learning experiences to:<br />1. Nurture self-directed and independent learners, and;<br />2. Develop passionate and intrinsically motivated learners.</p>
<p><p align="justify">Through both online and offline approaches to learning, we aim to provide students with opportunities to  <strong>learn at their own pace</strong>&nbsp;and be empowered to&nbsp;<strong>take charge of their learning</strong>&nbsp;for core curriculum as well as their interests beyond the syllabus.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Home-based Learning (HBL) Days</strong></h4>
<p><p align="justify"> HBL days are scheduled every fortnightly in Term 1 to 3 to complement teaching and learning in school.</p>

<p><p align="justify">On HBL days, students will have largely asynchronous lessons. The lesson resources will be assigned to students via&nbsp;<a href="https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Learning Space</a>.&nbsp;The schedule for HBL will follow students' class timetable to ensure learning continues for every subject. Students will also have scheduled time with their Form Teachers via Form Teacher Check-In (using Zoom) on HBL days so that the Form Teachers can continue to provide necessary support and guidance. Time is also set aside for Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) for students to pursue learning in areas of their interests and learn outside of the curriculum. The following shows the structure of a typical HBL day.</p>

The school has identified the following themes for students of different levels and curated learning packages to support our students&rsquo; learning in these areas:
<p><strong>Sec 1: Digital Literacies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sec 2: Subject Combination (Introduction to Upper Sec Subjects)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sec 3: General Interests</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sec 4: Education and Career Guidance&nbsp;</strong></p>
