<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4><p>In December 2020, MOE introduced Blended Learning (BL) as a key part of the schooling experience for our students. Students will learn what is prescribed by the curriculum through a mix of home-based and in-school activities, and leverage both online and offline approaches to learning. One key aspect of the BL approach is the integration of Home-based Learning (HBL) days as a regular feature of the schooling experience to complement teaching and learning in schools.</p><p>Blended Learning is supported by the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP), under which all secondary students will own a personal learning device (PLD)</p><h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4><p>At Peicai Secondary School, teachers design engaging Blended Learning experiences to:<br>1. Nurture self-directed and independent learners, and;<br>2. Develop passionate and intrinsically motivated learners.</p><p>Through both online and offline approaches to learning, we aim to provide students with opportunities to <strong>learn at their own pace</strong>&nbsp;and be empowered to&nbsp;<strong>take charge of their learning</strong>&nbsp;for core curriculum as well as their interests beyond the syllabus.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Home-based Learning (HBL) Days</strong></h4><p>HBL days are scheduled on some odd Wednesdays to complement teaching and learning in school.</p><p><strong>HBL Days for 2024</strong></p><p>Sec 1 to Sec 3:</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Term 1</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Term 2</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Term 3</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Term 4</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>31 Jan (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>20 Mar (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>10 Jul (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>16 Oct (Wed)</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>28 Feb (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>17 Apr (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>23 Jul (Tue)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>&nbsp;15 May (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>24 Jul (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>25 Jul (Thu)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Sec 4/5:</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Term 1</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Term 2</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Term 3</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>31 Jan (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>20 Mar (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>10 Jul (Wed)</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>17 Apr (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>23 Jul (Tue)</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>15 May (Wed)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>24 Jul (Wed)</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>25 Jul (Thu)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>On HBL days, students will have asynchronous learning with lesson resources assigned to students via &nbsp;<a href="https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Student Learning Space</a>.&nbsp;Secondary One students will also have Morning Check-in (using Zoom) on HBL days with their Form Teachers and classmates where they will discuss about learning dispositions and attitudes. Time is also set aside for Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) for all students to pursue learning in areas of their interests and learn outside of the curriculum.
