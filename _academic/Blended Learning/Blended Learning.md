<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p>In December 2020, MOE introduced Blended Learning (BL) as a key part of
the schooling experience for our students. Students will learn what is
prescribed by the curriculum through a mix of home-based and in-school
activities, and leverage both online and offline approaches to learning.
One key aspect of the BL approach is the integration of Home-based Learning
(HBL) days as a regular feature of the schooling experience to complement
teaching and learning in schools.</p>
<p>Blended Learning is supported by the National Digital Literacy Programme
(NDLP), under which all secondary students will own a personal learning
device (PLD)</p>
<h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4>
<p>At Peicai Secondary School, teachers design engaging Blended Learning
experiences to:
<br>1. Nurture self-directed and independent learners, and;
<br>2. Develop passionate and intrinsically motivated learners.</p>
<p>Through both online and offline approaches to learning, we aim to provide
students with opportunities to&nbsp;<strong>learn at their own pace</strong>&nbsp;and
be empowered to&nbsp;<strong>take charge of their learning</strong>&nbsp;for
core curriculum as well as their interests beyond the syllabus.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Home-based Learning (HBL) Days</strong></h4>
<p>HBL days are scheduled on some odd Wednesdays to complement teaching and
learning in school.</p>

<p>On HBL days, students will have asynchronous learning with lesson resources
assigned to students via &nbsp;<a href="https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Student Learning Space</a>.&nbsp;Secondary
One students will also have Morning Check-in (using Zoom) on HBL days with
their Form Teachers and classmates where they will discuss about learning
dispositions and attitudes. Time is also set aside for Student-Initiated
Learning (SIL) for all students to pursue learning in areas of their interests
and learn outside of the curriculum. The following shows the structure
of a typical HBL day.</p>
