<h4><strong>Expectations of Students on Home-Based Learning (HBL) Days</strong></h4>
<b>Objectives of HBL days</b><br>
Through regular HBL, the school aims to develop you into self-directed and independent learners, as well as nurture you into passionate and intrinsically motivated individuals. To this end, lessons on HBL days will be self-paced – the teachers provide you the resources, you plan and complete the work  assigned in your own time.<br>

<b>Features of HBL</b><br>
You can expect the following features of a HBL day:<br>
<ul>
<li>Learning will take place from home.</li>
<li>Asynchronous lesson. Your subject teachers for that day           will assign you learning tasks online, and you can decide             on the sequence of completing them. Your teachers will             also recommend the duration of time you should spend on         the learning tasks so as to help you better plan your                   learning schedule for the day.</li>
<li>You will be completing your learning tasks via different modes that include both online (eg. watching a video on YouTube) &amp; offline (e.g., completing a worksheet) activities so as to ensure that there is no excessive screen time.</li>
<li>Your teachers will monitor your learning and provide feedback so as to better guide your learning.</li></ul>

If you are going to be absent for HBL day, you should let your Form Teacher(s) know. All absence must be supported by appropriate documentation (e.g., Medical Certificate (MC)). Absence from
HBL day without any valid reasons will be considered as truancy.<br>

(III)	HBL Lessons and Student-Initiated Learning (SIL)
Subjects featured on HBL day are the same as the timetable for that day. Subject Teachers will
assign SLS lessons containing instructions for the day’s learning tasks before 8.20 am on HBL days.<br>

In order to have a fruitful HBL day, you should ensure that:<br>
<ul>
<li>You have all the learning materials (eg. textbook, notes and writing materials) required before you start the asynchronous lesson.</li>
<li>You read the SLS lesson’s ‘Lesson Description’ carefully before starting. You use the expected duration stated in each lesson to plan a schedule for the day.</li>
<li>You stay focused during the 6-hour timeslot (8.20 am to 2.35pm; inclusive of 20-min breaks between subject lessons) to complete the learning tasks assigned for the day.</li>
	<li>You reach out to your teachers if you face difficulties in completing the tasks assigned.</li>
<li>You spend at least 60 mins on their chosen Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) task and complete your SIL Reflection</li></ul>

(IV)	End of HBL day<br>
All lessons and work assigned must be completed and submitted (if necessary) by 6pm. If you face difficulties and require an extension of time for the completion of lessons or work assigned, you should reach out to and seek permission for time extension from your Subject Teachers.<br>

(V)	Learning Dispositions to Adopt
HBL days and the learning tasks are designed to encourage self-directedness in you. The following are some positive learning dispositions that you should adopt:<br>
<ul>
<li>Innovation – Be a critical and creative thinker when approaching and attempting the learning tasks. </li>
<li>Collaboration – Collaborate and learn with classmates (e.g., through the SLS Interactive Thinking Routines)</li>
	<li>Autonomy – Be an independent learner and disciplined in completing your learning tasks.</li>
<li>Resilience – Keep trying until successful; do not give up just because learning tasks are long, tedious and tough. </li>
<li>Enthusiasm – Be excited about learning and be amazed by the wonderment and awe of acquiring new knowledge and skills. Extend a helping hand towards classmates who are having difficulties.</li><br>
