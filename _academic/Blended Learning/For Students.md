<h4><strong>Expectations of Students on Home-Based Learning (HBL) Days</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Objectives of HBL days</strong>
<br>Through regular HBL, the school aims to develop you into self-directed
and independent learners, as well as nurture you into passionate and intrinsically
motivated individuals. To this end, lessons on HBL days will be self-paced
– the teachers provide you the resources, you plan and complete the work
assigned in your own time.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Features of HBL</strong>
<br>You can expect the following features of a HBL day:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Learning will take place from home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asynchronous lesson. Your subject teachers for that day will assign you
learning tasks online, and you can decide on the sequence of completing
them. Your teachers will also recommend the duration of time you should
spend on the learning tasks so as to help you better plan your learning
schedule for the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be completing your learning tasks via different modes that include
both online (eg. watching a video on YouTube) &amp; offline (e.g., completing
a worksheet) activities so as to ensure that there is no excessive screen
time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your teachers will monitor your learning and provide feedback so as to
better guide your learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>

at the start of the day by:

for Morning Check-in which will take place for every first HBL of the month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal learning devices (PLDs) should be fully charged or plugged in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being seated as you would be in the classroom, i.e. not in bed, reclining
on the sofa, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logging into SLS and checking the announcements and assigned lessons for

</li>
<li>
<p>Reading the lesson description for each assigned SLS lesson carefully.</p>

late for Morning Check-In, you should contact your Form Teacher(s) and
inform them.
<br>
</p>
<p>If you are going to be absent for HBL day, you should let your Form Teacher(s)
know. All absence must be supported by appropriate documentation (e.g.,
Medical Certificate (MC)). Absence from HBL day without any valid reasons
will be considered as truancy.
<br>
</p>
<p>(III) HBL Lessons and Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) Subjects featured
on HBL day are the same as the timetable for that day. Subject Teachers
will assign SLS lessons containing instructions for the day’s learning
tasks before 8.20 am on HBL days.
<br>
</p>
<p>In order to have a fruitful HBL day, you should ensure that:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You have all the learning materials (eg. textbook, notes and writing materials)
required before you start the asynchronous lesson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You read the SLS lesson’s ‘Lesson Description’ carefully before starting.
You use the expected duration stated in each lesson to plan a schedule
for the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You stay focused during the 6-hour timeslot (8.20 am to 2.35pm; inclusive
of 20-min breaks between subject lessons) to complete the learning tasks
assigned for the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You reach out to your teachers if you face difficulties in completing
the tasks assigned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You spend at least 60 mins on their chosen Student-Initiated Learning
(SIL) task and complete your SIL Reflection</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(IV) End of HBL day
<br>All lessons and work assigned must be completed and submitted (if necessary)
by 6pm. If you face difficulties and require an extension of time for the
completion of lessons or work assigned, you should reach out to and seek
permission for time extension from your Subject Teachers.
<br>
</p>
<p>(V) Learning Dispositions to Adopt HBL days and the learning tasks are
designed to encourage self-directedness in you. The following are some
positive learning dispositions that you should adopt:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Innovation – Be a critical and creative thinker when approaching and attempting
the learning tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaboration – Collaborate and learn with classmates (e.g., through the
SLS Interactive Thinking Routines)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Autonomy – Be an independent learner and disciplined in completing your
learning tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resilience – Keep trying until successful; do not give up just because
learning tasks are long, tedious and tough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enthusiasm – Be excited about learning and be amazed by the wonderment
and awe of acquiring new knowledge and skills. Extend a helping hand towards
classmates who are having difficulties.
