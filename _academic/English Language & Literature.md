<p dir="ltr">We support these endeavours through:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">Student-centric instruction, focusing on active meaning making</li>
<li dir="ltr">Making students' thought process visible through <em>responding through dialogue and writing</em></li>
<li dir="ltr">Allowing students to <em>experience story, appreciate writer's style and interpret themes</em></li>
<li dir="ltr">Having rich discussions to enable students to <em>make connections between the text and their own lives, the world, other readers and other texts. </em></li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">This is done through the Literary Response framework as shown below:</p>
<img src="/images/ell2.png">
	<p dir="ltr">This Literary Response Framework represents how teachers will design learning experiences that encourage students to respond to texts in a holistic manner. The Framework is shaped like an eye to emphasise how responding to Literature empowers students to read texts and the world in different ways and with discernment.</p>
<h4><strong>Department Programmes</strong></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Public Speaking Programme</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">In the English classroom, students are given ample opportunity to develop their confidence in public speaking through Show and Tell and the Speech of the Day, where students are given time to share about a given topic. Students are also trained in public speaking skills and creating videos on language skills.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Representatives are identified and trained for the Plain English Speaking Award organised by YMCA.</p>
