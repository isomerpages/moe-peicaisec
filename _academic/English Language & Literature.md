<h4><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>

<ol>
<li dir="ltr"><strong>Empathetic communicators</strong> who possess the values, dispositions and skills to listen actively to different perspectives; communicate confidently, effectively and sensitively while collaborating with others to work towards shared goals; and balance an appreciation of the Singapore spirit with multi-ethnic and multicultural sensitivities.&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong>Discerning Readers</strong> who possess broad worldviews by staying well informed and self-directed in the use of information, and are able to distinguish fact from falsehood by processing and evaluating information closely, critically and with discernment according to purpose, audience, context and culture.&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong>Creative Inquirers</strong> who explore and evaluate real-world issues and multiple perspectives as well as gather and synthesise information from diverse print, non-print and digital networked sources, so as to cocreate knowledge and solutions in familiar or new contexts</li>
</ol>

<p dir="ltr">We support these endeavours through:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">Student-centric instruction, focusing on active meaning making</li>
<li dir="ltr">Making students' thought process visible through <em>responding through dialogue and writing</em></li>
<li dir="ltr">Allowing students to <em>experience story, appreciate writer's style and interpret themes</em></li>
<li dir="ltr">Having rich discussions to enable students to <em>make connections between the text and their own lives, the world, other readers and other texts. </em></li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">This is done through the Literary Response framework as shown below:</p>

	<p dir="ltr">This Literary Response Framework represents how teachers will design learning experiences that encourage students to respond to texts in a holistic manner. The Framework is shaped like an eye to emphasise how responding to Literature empowers students to read texts and the world in different ways and with discernment.</p>
<h4><strong>Department Programmes</strong></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Public Speaking Programme</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">In the English classroom, students are given ample opportunity to develop their confidence in public speaking through Show and Tell and the Speech of the Day, where students are given time to share about a given topic. Students are also trained in public speaking skills and creating videos on language skills.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Representatives are identified and trained for the Plain English Speaking Award organised by YMCA.</p>
