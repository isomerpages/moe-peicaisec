<h4><strong>Department Vision:</strong></h4>
<p>ACE in English!</p>
<h4><strong>Department Mission:</strong></h4>
<p>To produce Articulate, Competent and Effective (ACE) users of Standard English who are able to communicate in different contexts to achieve desired purposes.</p>
<p>In Peicai, we believe in a holistic approach in the teaching and learning of English Language and Literature. English Language is critical for communication in the real world, for us to develop our thinking and to express ourselves effectively. Literature develops one&rsquo;s awareness of the human condition and the world beyond their own, and promotes empathy and critical thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The English Language curriculum is based on MOE&rsquo;s 2010 EL Syllabus, which focuses on a 'A Strong Foundation and Rich Language for All'. Our programmes are aimed at developing students&rsquo; competencies in reading, writing and communicating. We believe that these skills are essential for students to be effective and confident users of the language, and will help to develop students&rsquo; critical thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Literature programmes aim to develop in students a love of reading, as students are exposed to a range of genres and texts in their study of Literature. More importantly, students will learn to understand diverse perspectives, appreciate the aesthetic quality of language, make meaning of texts as they navigate them and be thoughtful, discerning readers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Programmes</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading Programme</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are exposed to a wide range of texts types through magazines and library visits. In class, time is spent on discussing contemporary issues raised in the magazines, and students develop good reading habits.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>English Week</li>
</ul>
<p>Students participate in various activities aimed at developing an appreciation for the language. Competitions are held where students demonstrate their understanding of the language through skits and performances.&nbsp;In 2020, students participated in a slew of activities, including the Secondary One students exercising their creative chops in creating a 55 word story.</p>

<ul>
<li>Public Speaking</li>
</ul>
<p>In the English classroom, students are given ample opportunity to develop their confidence in public speaking through Show and Tell and the Speech of the Day, where students are given time to share about a given topic. Students are also trained, and create videos on language skills which are played across the school.</p>
<p>Our students also participate in the annual Secondary School Debating Championships, and representatives are identified and trained for the Plain English Speaking Award.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Literature Theatre Appreciation</li>
</ul>
<p>To expose students to different genres of Literature and to give them an opportunity to see texts/plays come alive, theatre appreciation trips are planned for the Upper Secondary Literature students each year. In 2019, students were treated to the production of Phantom of the Opera, and in 2018, students attended the staging of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time.&nbsp;</p>
