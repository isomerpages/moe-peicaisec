<p>The Mathematics department seeks to develop an inquiring mind and a passion for learning Mathematics through quality instruction and programmes. The PCSS Mathematics curriculum is broad-based at the lower secondary level, covering a range of concepts, skills and processes. Students do a more in-depth study into various strands at the upper secondary level, going beyond examinations to prepare them for the real world outside the confines of the classroom.</p>
<p><u>Teaching and Learning<br /></u>Teaching and learning is differentiated to pique students&rsquo; interest and a spiral approach is adopted for each strand, with interdisciplinary connections made. The curriculum incorporates a spectrum of learning experiences to facilitate students&rsquo; learning, foster critical and inventive thinking, and to nurture their intellectual capacity. The department is on board the Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN) project, in collaboration with S6 Cluster Schools. The partnership works synergistically to develop interactive&nbsp;lesson packages that improve students' proficiency in using the mathematical language and address topic-specific learning gaps. </p>

<p>To extend mathematics learning beyond the textbooks, the department has a few programmes to make learning more relevant and interesting.</p>
<p><u>Mathematics modelling<br /></u>Mathematics modelling is integrated into the curriculum to highlight the importance and relevance of Mathematics in a real-world context. In Mathematics modelling, students work collaboratively in groups to solve real-world problems that are multi-faceted and open to multiple approaches. Students need to make calculated choices about what is important, decide what Mathematics principles to apply and determine whether their solution is relevant and useful. Students persevere through challenges, learn from the approaches taken by others and surprise us with the ways they can use Mathematics to tackle problems that matter to them and the society.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Mathematics and Science Week<br /></u>Mathematics Week is another hallmark event in our department. It seeks to encourage appreciation and understanding of Mathematics through a variety of activities. The activities cover a myriad of topics and promote the interdisciplinary nature of Mathematics&nbsp;and other disciplines. For example, students get a chance to break out of a digital Escape Room designed by our own teachers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Talent Management Programme<br /></u>There are ample opportunities for students who show interest and demonstrate stronger ability in Mathematics to stretch their potential. Such opportunities include the ICAS Mathematics by UNSW and All Singapore Secondary Mathematics Competition for Normal Course Students. In addition to the competitions, there are also enrichment programmes to further develop these students</p>
