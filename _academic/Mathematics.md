<h4><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>Mathematics:<br /></u></strong>Mathematics underpins many aspects of our daily life, from making sense of information to making informed decisions. It contributes to the developments and understanding in multiple disciplines and provides the foundation for many of today&rsquo;s innovations and tomorrow&rsquo;s solutions. Mathematics education plays an important role in equipping students with the necessary knowledge and skills and the capacities to think logically, critically, and analytically to participate and strive in the future workplace.</p>
<p>At Peicai Secondary school, we aim to develop in our students an inquiring mind and a passion for learning Mathematics. We also give attention to developing students&rsquo; metacognition by promoting self-directed learning and reflection.</p>
<p><strong><u>Computer Applications:<br /></u></strong>The invention and advancement of computers has revolutionized the way we live, work and learn. Having the knowledge and skills to tap on the power of computers makes a person more efficient.</p>
<p>At Peicai Secondary school, we aim to develop in our students&rsquo; skills in using a variety of computer application software and hardware to accomplish tasks and communicate ideas. We also give attention to developing students&rsquo; basic computational thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p><strong><u>Mathematics<br /></u></strong>We support these endeavours through quality instruction and programmes. Peicai Mathematics department adopts a spiral approach in teaching where each skill is reviewed and revisited repeatedly over months and across levels. Each time the material is revisited, more depth is added, linking new concepts to prior learning. Spiralling helps students to make connections over time, which creates more robust pathways for recalling information and produces deeper, more conceptual learning.</p>
<p>To help students to become more proficient in mathematics, we are explicit about using instructional routines that focus on student engagement in activities that support reasoning, communication with and about mathematical ideas, building procedural fluency from conceptual understanding and productive struggle. We also teach our students mathematical routines to help students derive an approach to analysing and solving questions comfortably. These routines level up students&rsquo; confidence, competence and motivation in learning mathematics.</p>
<p><strong><u>Computer Applications<br /></u></strong>We support these endeavours through quality instruction and programmes. Peicai Computer Applications lessons are hands-on and interactive. The CPA unit also ensured that students learn basic computational thinking skills such as algorithmic thinking and decomposition through creating animations and games.</p>
<h4><strong>Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>Maths enrichment at Peicai harnesses the talents of our students, inspires and empowers them through learning, mentorship and leadership opportunities. Students strengthen their mathematical knowledge, develop computational thinking skills and broaden their perspectives through competitions and experiential learning. There are also opportunities for students to lead, plan and implement events to nurture them to be leaders in the field and to develop passion and deep subject mastery.</p>
