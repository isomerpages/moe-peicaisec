<h4><strong>Purpose and Implementation of Full SBB</strong></h4>
<p></p><p align="justify">Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.</p>
<p></p><p align="justify">With Full SBB in secondary schools, students will have greater flexibility to study more subjects at different levels that suit their interests, aptitude and learning needs. There will no longer be separate Express, N(A), and N(T) streams, and students will be in mixed form classes where they can interact with peers of different strengths and interests.</p>
<p align="justify">Every child will continue to have access to opportunities, throughout their education journey, to develop their unique talents and fulfil their potential in life.
</p>
<p><b>Removal of Express, Normal(Academic) [N(A)] and Normal(Technical) [N(T)] streams</b></p>

<p align="justify">MOE will post students to secondary school through three Posting Groups – Posting Groups 1, 2, and 3. The PSLE score ranges for the three Posting Groups will be mapped from the existing N(T), N(A) and Express streams respectively. Posting Groups will only be used for the purposes of admitting students into secondary school and to guide the initial subject levels students can offer at the start of Secondary One.
</p>
<p align="justify">Throughout their secondary school education, students can take subjects at three subject levels, known as G1, G2, G3 (G stands for General), mapped from today's N(T), N(A) and Express standards respectively. Students will have the flexibility to adjust their subject levels at appropriate junctures, based on their strengths, interests and learning needs. Students will subsequently access programmes and post-secondary pathways based on their various subjects and subject level combinations.
</p><p></p>
<p><b>Offering subjects at a more demanding level</b></p>
<p align="justify">At the start of Secondary One, eligible students can offer English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science at a more demanding level based on their PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each of these subjects. Beyond the start of Secondary One, students may also offer these subjects at a more demanding level based on their performance in secondary school.</p>
