<h4><strong>Purpose and Implementation of Full SBB</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning
and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests
of our students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With Full SBB in secondary schools, students will have greater flexibility
to study more subjects at different levels that suit their interests, aptitude
and learning needs. There will no longer be separate Express, N(A), and
N(T) streams, and students will be in mixed form classes where they can
interact with peers of different strengths and interests.</p>
<p>Every child will continue to have access to opportunities, throughout
their education journey, to develop their unique talents and fulfil their
potential in life.</p>
<p><strong>Removal of Express, Normal(Academic) [N(A)] and Normal(Technical) [N(T)] streams</strong>
</p>
<p>MOE will post students to secondary school through three Posting Groups
– Posting Groups 1, 2, and 3. The PSLE score ranges for the three Posting
Groups will be mapped from the existing N(T), N(A) and Express streams
respectively. Posting Groups will only be used for the purposes of admitting
students into secondary school and to guide the initial subject levels
students can offer at the start of Secondary One.</p>
<p>Throughout their secondary school education, students can take subjects
at three subject levels, known as G1, G2, G3 (G stands for General), mapped
from today's N(T), N(A) and Express standards respectively. Students will
have the flexibility to adjust their subject levels at appropriate junctures,
based on their strengths, interests and learning needs. Students will subsequently
access programmes and post-secondary pathways based on their various subjects
and subject level combinations.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Offering subjects at a more demanding level</strong>
</p>
<p>At the start of Secondary One, eligible students can offer English Language,
Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science at a more demanding level
based on their PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each of these subjects.
Beyond the start of Secondary One, students may also offer these subjects
at a more demanding level based on their performance in secondary school.</p>
<p>From Secondary Two, students will also be able to offer Humanities subjects
(Geography, History, and Literature in English) at a more demanding level.
The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based
on students' aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary One.</p>
<p><strong>Offering subjects at a less demanding level</strong>
</p>
<p>At the start of Secondary One, students will generally start with subjects
at a subject level based on their overall PSLE Score, or at a more demanding
level based on their performance in individual PSLE subjects. In some instances,
students may have flexibility to offer some subjects at a less demanding
level from Secondary One. Students who face exceptional difficulties coping
with their Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) will have the option to offer
G1 or G2 MTL based on a set of MOE-stipulated criteria.</p>
<p>For students who offered English, Mathematics and/or Science at Foundation
level at PSLE, but are otherwise eligible to take most of their subjects
at G3 when entering secondary school, they may choose to take these subjects
at a less demanding level (i.e., G2), in consultation with the school.</p>
<p><strong>Mixed form classes</strong>
</p>
<p>Once students enter secondary school, they will be grouped into mixed
form classes comprising students from different Posting Groups and will
have opportunities to interact and learn with peers of different backgrounds,
strengths, and interests.</p>
