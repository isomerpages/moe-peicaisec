<h4><strong>Purpose and Implementation of Full SBB</strong></h4>
<p>Full SBB is part of MOE&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.</p>
<p>By 2024, secondary schools will have implemented the following aspects of Full SBB:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offering of English, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Language at a more demanding level from Secondary 1 for both N(A) and N(T) students who meet the eligibility criteria</li>
<li>Offering of Humanities subjects (Geography, History, Literature in English) at a more demanding level from Secondary 2 for both N(A) and N(T) students who meet the eligibility criteria</li>
<li>Mixed Form Classes where the students will have a common curriculum for the Craft &amp; Technology subjects (Art, Design &amp; Technology, Food &amp; Consumer Education), Physical Education, Music and Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</li>
</ul>
