<h4><strong>Department Vision:</strong></h4>
<p>To be a value-added department that inspires the students&rsquo; love for their culture.</p>
<h4><strong>Department Mission:</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture in our students a strong foundation in their Mother Tongue Languages and an enduring interest in their culture.</p>
<h4><strong>Chinese Language and Culture</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Chinese Language<br /></strong>To achieve our Mother Tongue department mission, we embark on several programmes to enhance our students&rsquo; language skills. These programmes include &lsquo;Class Library Programme&rsquo;, the &lsquo;MTL Intensive Programme for our Graduating Classes&rsquo; as well as the &lsquo;Conversational Chinese and Malay Programme&rsquo; for our Secondary One students.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese Culture<br /></strong>To inspire the students&rsquo; love for their culture, and to seize every opportunity to teach our students values, we organise the following activities for our students each year:</p>
<p><u>Chinese New Year concert and Hamper Wrapping for Lion&rsquo;s Home for the Aged<br /></u>On the eve of Chinese New Year, a joyous occasion, we want our students to not only enjoy but to remember the less privileged old folks. Together with the VIA coordinator, we organise a hamper wrapping competition. All hampers made by the students would be given to the old folks from Lions&rsquo; Home. The old folks are also invited to enjoy the multi-racial concert celebration we have in school.</p>
<p><u>MT Fortnight Cultural activities for our students<br /></u>In order to expose our students to different cultural activities, we organise various activities for our students during the Mother Tongue fortnight, such as Lion Dance, cultural musical instrument appreciation, clay sculpture, Chinese Chess Competition and bamboo books.&nbsp;</p>
