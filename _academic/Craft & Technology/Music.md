<h4><strong>MUSIC</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Desired Outcomes</strong>
</p>
<p>In Peicai Secondary School, we aim to develop in students the competencies
that will enable them to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Learn basic music concepts and skills through Listening, Creating and
Performing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deepen their appreciation for music from local and global cultures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Express themselves through music creation and performances.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We support these endeavours through…</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Equipping students with the necessary musical competencies in instrumental
and ensemble playing. (ukulele and keyboard).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engaging students in analysing and evaluating musical works through the
Performing Arts -Based Learning experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infusing technological skills in music arrangement and compositions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We provide a two year lower secondary music curriculum to equip our students
with theoretical knowledge and develop their musicianship. It is also aligned
to the school’s Aesthetic Programme where music is seen as an integral
part of students’ lives. We believe that every child possesses innate musical
abilities and should&nbsp;be given the opportunity to develop his/her potential
in creative expression through Music education in school.</p>
