<ol>
<li><p align="justify">Equipping students with the necessary musical skills and knowledge of instrumental playing (ukulele and keyboard).
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Engaging students in analysing and evaluating musical works.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Infusing technological skills in song arrangements and song writing.
</p><p></p><p align="justify">We provide a two year lower secondary music curriculum to develop and equip our students with the fundamental skills and techniques in music making. It is also aligned to the school’s Aesthetic Education Programme where music is seen as an integral part of students’ lives. We believe that every child should&nbsp;be given the opportunity to develop his/her potential in creative expression through Music education in school.</p>
