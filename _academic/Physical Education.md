<h4><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>In Peicai, our Physical Education Programme places strong emphasis on
developing students with cognitive, affective and physical abilities that
will enable them to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle. In addition
to enhancing their physical fitness, students will cultivate essential
attributes such as discipline, teamwork, and resilience.</p>
<p>The Learning Outcomes (LOs) in the learning areas for the secondary level
build on the movement capacity and knowledge that were learnt at the primary
level.</p>
<p>For<strong>&nbsp;Physical Activity,</strong>&nbsp;the LOs are premised
on the expected student competence in a recreational context at the end
of each module. Thus, the LOs for the physical activities are applicable
to any level in secondary schools.</p>
<p>For<strong>&nbsp;Outdoor Education,</strong>&nbsp;the LOs are organised
in a modular format in the topics of Navigation, Outdoor Cooking, Shelter
Building, and Trip Planning, and show integration of the 3 strands. Each
topic consists of two modules and specifies minimally what students should
achieve by the end of Secondary 1 and by the end of Secondary 3. In other
words, the content to be achieved by the end of Secondary 3 can be taught
in Secondary 2 and/or Secondary 3 to prepare students for their outdoor
adventure learning cohort camps.</p>
<p>For<strong>&nbsp;Physical Health &amp; Safety,</strong> the LOs specify
minimally what students should know and be able to do for these two areas
by the end of each secondary level. The content in the four strands of
Physical Health are taught from Secondary 1 to 4 as we continue to build
sustainable habits in our students particularly in their daily diet, to
their fitness management methods.</p>

<p><strong>Programme Highlight: Peicai Sports Day</strong>

<p>Through a myriad of track events such as the 100m, 200m, 400m and 4x100m
relay sprints, as well as inter-class tele matches, our Annual Sports Day
enables our students to foster a strong camaraderie amongst classmates

<p><strong>Programme Highlight: Cohort Sports Challenge</strong>
</p>
<p>The knowledge, skills and attributes upon the completion of the sports
curriculum will culminate in their participation at the inter-class tournament
that serves as a platform for them to test their acquired skills in a competition
setting and encourages them to focus.</p>
<p>These inter-class challenges are anchored on core values (respect, responsibility,
resilience, integrity, care and harmony) which allows students to be able
to work collaboratively with their classmates and aim to be inclusive to
every member by fielding all students in the class for games in a celebration
of sports.</p>

<p><strong>Outdoor Activity Learning Highlight: Secondary 2 Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) Camp</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Sec 2 OAL camp provides valuable learning opportunities for students,
offering an unfamiliar yet authentic environment that fosters in student’s
self-awareness, cultivates creative capital and problem-solving skills.
It brings together students in the class from diverse backgrounds for insights
from various perspectives in an outdoor environment that encourages collaborative
play, work, and learning.</p>
<p>Students develop appropriate outdoor competencies (i.e., knowledge, skills,
and attitudes) through physical activities while cultivating an attitude
of care and appreciation for the environment, and thoughtful consideration
of the risks and safety of self and others. Young learners optimize the
use of their senses to be comfortable during their outdoor explorations.
Familiar and unfamiliar places, in diverse natural and urban environments,
provide dynamic situations for advanced learners to be adventurous, safe,
and make good judgements in a wider range of outdoor activities.</p>

<p><strong>Outdoor Activity Learning Highlight: Secondary 3 MOE-OBS Challenge Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The signature programme by Outward Bound Singapore for the Sec 3 cohort
is a 5-day, 4-night residential programme that aims to effectively develop
students to have resilience and to be confident through self-guded education
in the outdoors, and impactful decision-making during the customised activities.</p>
<p>Students will be exposed to a wider scope of outdoor elements, and they
will also learn how to work with their teammates from different schools
to overcome challenges together. Social mixing is one of the core elements
of the MOE-OBS Challenge Programme, as students will also have an opportunity
to interact in a group made up of students from other schools.</p>
