<h4><strong>Physical Education </strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p></p><p align="justify">In Peicai, our Physical Education programme places strong emphasis on developing students with cognitive, affective and physical abilities that will enable them to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle. In addition to enhancing their physical fitness, students will cultivate essential attributes such as discipline, teamwork, and resilience.</p>
<p></p><p align="justify">The Learning Outcomes (LOs) in the learning areas for the secondary level build on the movement capacity and knowledge that were learnt at the primary level.<br></p><li>For<b> Physical Activity,</b> the LOs are premised on the expected student competence in a recreational context at the end of each module. Thus, the LOs for the physical activities are applicable to any level in secondary schools.<br></li><li>For<b> Outdoor Education,</b> the LOs are organised in a modular format in the topics of Navigation, Outdoor Cooking, Shelter Building, and Trip Planning, and show integration of the 3 strands. Each topic consists of two modules and specifies minimally what students should achieve by the end of Secondary 1 and by the end of Secondary 3. In other words, the content to be achieved by the end of Secondary 3 can be taught in Secondary 2 and/or Secondary 3 to prepare students for their outdoor adventure learning cohort camps.<br></li><li>For<b> Physical Health &amp; Safety,</b>the LOs specify minimally what students should know and be able to do for these two areas by the end of each secondary level. The content in the four strands of Physical Health are taught from Secondary 1 to 4.<br></li><p></p>
