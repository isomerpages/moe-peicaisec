<p><p align="justify">The purpose of physical education (PE) is to enable students to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living. There are 6 equally important goals in PE. They each interacts with others in a well-planned programme that addresses the knowledge, skills, and values desired for every student. The PE programme seeks to develop in each student the ability to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><p align="justify">Acquire a range of movement skills to participate in a variety of physical activities.<br><li> Understand and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in a range of physical activities.<br><li>Demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment.<br><li>Display positive personal and social behaviour across different experiences.<br><li>Acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness through regular participation in physical activities.<br><li>Enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.
<p><p align="justify">We support these endeavours through quality instruction and programmes. Peicai PE department adopts the Games Concept Approach (GCA) in which students explore and gain interests in sports through gameplays. Through the GCA approach, students gain knowledge in gameplays and discover the need to improve their skills in the different areas, making the purpose to learn in PE more meaningful and enjoyable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;In Peicai, students experience a wide range of activities other than the instructional programme. The following are some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cross Country<br /></strong><p align="justify">This is a school event in which the whole school will take part in a race. This event is usually held outside school, where students and staff get to be engaged in a healthy physical activity together.</li>
<li><strong>Sports Challenge<br /></strong>This is a level-based event in which students compete with their peers from the same level. The inter-class games component includes games that the students have learnt during their PE lessons. The other component is the sports exposure programme in which students are exposed to unique sports that they will not get to experience in their daily PE lessons.</li>
<li><strong>Sec 2 Level Camp<br /></strong>The Sec 2 level camp is conducted annually for the Sec 2 students. During this camp, the students get to experience activities such as kayaking and field cooking together with their classmates.</li>
<li><strong>Sec 3 Outward Bound Singapore Camp<br /></strong>The Sec 3 OBS camp is conducted annually externally by OBS. During this camp, the students get to interact and experience unique activities such as expeditions, with teammates who may come from different classes or even schools (pre-covid).&nbsp;</li>
