<p>The Physical Education (PE) Programme in Peicai aims to develop the physical, cognitive, social and affective aspects of all Peicaians through physical activities. The department aims to equip our students with sufficient knowledge and skills in order for them to continue pursuing a life-long physically active and healthy lifestyle through sports and games after graduation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PE curriculum in Peicai is closely aligned to the new PE Syllabus 2014. Every Peicaian gets the opportunity to learn different sports and games such as Softball, Basketball and Volleyball. The department adopted the Games Concept Approach in the teaching of sports and games. Through this approach, the acquisition of the games concepts and knowledge enables students to appreciate the games better, which results in them being more involved during sporting times such as the Olympic Games and Soccer World Cup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides sports and games, our students are also engaged in Physical Health and Fitness as well as Outdoor Education modules during their four or five years in Peicai. All Peicaians not only get an opportunity to attend the Secondary Two Level Camp, solely planned and executed by the PE department, they also get to attend the Outward Bound School (OBS) camp in Secondary Three.&nbsp;Aligned to the school&rsquo;s strategic thrusts, character and values are often emphasized during PE programmes. We strongly believe that the PE programmes, such as the Annual Sports Carnival as well as all the outdoor camps, are good platforms for authentic learning and character development.</p>
<p>Our key programmes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondary Two Level Camp</li>
<li>Secondary Three OBS programme</li>
<li>Peicai Fun Run</li>
<li>Sports Carnival for Secondary One to Three students</li>
