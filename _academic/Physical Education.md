<h4><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>In Peicai, our Physical Education Programme places strong emphasis on
developing students with cognitive, affective and physical abilities that
will enable them to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle. In addition
to enhancing their physical fitness, students will cultivate essential
attributes such as discipline, teamwork, and resilience.</p>
<p>The Learning Outcomes (LOs) in the learning areas for the secondary level
build on the movement capacity and knowledge that were learnt at the primary
level.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For<strong>&nbsp;Physical Activity,</strong>&nbsp;the LOs are premised
on the expected student competence in a recreational context at the end
of each module. Thus, the LOs for the physical activities are applicable
to any level in secondary schools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For<strong>&nbsp;Outdoor Education,</strong>&nbsp;the LOs are organised
in a modular format in the topics of Navigation, Outdoor Cooking, Shelter
Building, and Trip Planning, and show integration of the 3 strands. Each
topic consists of two modules and specifies minimally what students should
achieve by the end of Secondary 1 and by the end of Secondary 3. In other
words, the content to be achieved by the end of Secondary 3 can be taught
in Secondary 2 and/or Secondary 3 to prepare students for their outdoor
adventure learning cohort camps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For<strong>&nbsp;Physical Health &amp; Safety,</strong>the LOs specify
minimally what students should know and be able to do for these two areas
by the end of each secondary level. The content in the four strands of
Physical Health are taught from Secondary 1 to 4.</p>

<p><strong>Programme Highlight: Peicai Sports Day</strong>
</p>
<p>Through a myriad of track events and inter-class tele matches, our Annual
Sports Day enables our students to foster a strong camaraderie amongst
classmates through the spirit of competition. Through these series of competitive
events, it builds up class and cohort spirit, that allows students to engage
in healthy activities as one. It is also a chance for students to apply
what they have learnt through the Athletics module in their daily PE lessons.</p>

<p><strong>Programme Highlight: Cohort Sports Challenge</strong>
<br>The knowledge, skills and attributes upon the completion of the sports
curriculum will culminate in their participation at the inter-class tournament
that serves as a platform for them to test their acquired skills in a competition
setting and encourages them to focus. These inter-class challenges are
anchored on core values (respect, responsibility, resilience, integrity,
care and harmony) which allows students to be able to work collaboratively
with their classmates and aim to be inclusive to every member by fielding
all students in the class for games in a celebration of sports.</p>

<p><strong>Outdoor Activity Learning Highlight: Secondary 2 Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) Camp</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Sec 2 OAL camp provides valuable learning opportunities for students,
offering an unfamiliar yet authentic environment that fosters in student’s
self-awareness, cultivates creative capital and problem-solving skills.
It brings together students in the class from diverse backgrounds for insights
from various perspectives in an outdoor environment that encourages collaborative
play, work, and learning. Students develop appropriate outdoor competencies
(i.e., knowledge, skills, and attitudes) through physical activities while
cultivating an attitude of care and appreciation for the environment, and
thoughtful consideration of the risks and safety of self and others. Young
learners optimize the use of their senses to be comfortable during their
outdoor explorations. Familiar and unfamiliar places, in diverse natural
and urban environments, provide dynamic situations for advanced learners
to be adventurous, safe, and make good judgements in a wider range of outdoor
activities.</p>
