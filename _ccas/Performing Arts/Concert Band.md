<p>Our Band&rsquo;s motto is &ldquo;One Band, One Family, One Sound.&rdquo; We hope to nurture our Band members to be responsible and resilient team players through music. Founded in 1984, Peicai Concert Band is a very unique Co-Curricular Activity as most of our Band members start off without any music background. Our Band may be small in size but has achieved much over the years. One of our achievements is clinching the Certificate of Accomplishment in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation in 2015 and 2017. In fact, our Band was one of the smallest Bands among all the participating schools in 2015.</p>
<p>Other than taking part in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, our Band demonstrates consideration and empathy for others in the community. In 2015, we performed for 1000 over guests at Safra@Jurong. In addition, we are active participants of the Values-in-Action Projects such as Arts@KKH and Musicfest@SGH where we perform for the patients, visitors and staff. In 2019, our Band performed at the Sengkang General hospital and the&nbsp;ZARTS FEST 2019 @ZHPS.</p>

<p>Our repertoire includes pieces from classical music to pop music. We also take part in the biennial Ignite public concert and are given the platform to collaborate with the rest of the performing arts groups in the school. It is&nbsp;definitely a challenging yet fulfilling experience for all the Ignite performers as the school values of perseverance, respect and empathy are being displayed throughout the rehearsals and actual event. Every year we also perform at the National Day and Chinese New Year celebrations in school.</p>
<p>Our Band members are given the platform to develop teamwork&nbsp;and a strong sense of musicality during their annual Band workshop and school exchange programme.&nbsp;</p>
