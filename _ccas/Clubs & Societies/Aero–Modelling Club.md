<p>The Aeromodelling Club offers an avenue for students who are interested in aviation and aeronautical activities. Students get to design and make their own gliders using aerodynamic theory. With their gliders, students participate in the annual SAFMC (Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition) where they are also needed to articulate flying principles to a panel of judges. More information on SAFMC can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2A6Vnd66zc">link</a>&nbsp;here.&nbsp;However, with COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the competition was cancelled. To not dampen their spirits, an internal school SAFMC was conducted and they enjoyed it very much.</p>

<p>Online activities using Zoom &amp; SLS platforms were also used to engage students during this difficult time.</p>
<p>Besides gliders, students also learn to fly drones. They develop skills to&nbsp;maneuver&nbsp;drones as a team and develop mental strength when performing in front of a crowd; members participate in the drone during school&rsquo;s Award&rsquo;s Day and National Day celebrations. To test their ability in handling airplane operation, students also learn to use flight simulators. </p>
<p>Learning Journeys to relevant institutions (for example Airforce Museum, Gardens by the Bay etc.) and team bonding games are also conducted to engage and excite the students.</p>
