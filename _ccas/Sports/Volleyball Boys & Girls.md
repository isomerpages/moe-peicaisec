<p>Resilience, teamwork, composure and perseverance are the hallmark of Peicai&rsquo;s Volleyball CCA. The teachers and coach strongly believe that a player&rsquo;s character determines her performance in the court. Thus, we emphasize not just CCA excellence but also on character and leadership development.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Volleyball Girls</strong></u></p>
<p>Each year, our girls participate in the South Zone &lsquo;B&rsquo; and &lsquo;C&rsquo; Division Championships. Apart from that, we also take part in the friendly matches. Such opportunities enable the girls to become mentally and athletically stronger. Through the team sport, the girls also form good relationships with each other</p>

<p><strong><u>Volleyball Boys</u></strong></p>
<p>The boys&rsquo; team was started in 2020 by Mr Mark Koh, and under his tutelage have been training very hard. Through the training, the boys learn team work and gain confidence.</p>
<p>We also provide opportunities for the players to bond through our yearly Values In Action programmes, where students are able to contribute to the community. Such activities allow the students to put their thoughts in action and thereafter reflect on how their own habits and actions affect the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Always striving to reach their goals, the students go an extra mile to hone their skills and also to seize all opportunities during the matches. The success of this CCA is also attributed to our students&rsquo; parents who have rendered their full support.&nbsp;</p>
