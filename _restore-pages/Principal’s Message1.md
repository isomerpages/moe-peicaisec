<p><strong>Principal's Message</strong></p> 
<p><p align="justify"><font size="3">It is with much pleasure that I take on my appointment as Principal of Peicai Secondary School&ndash; a school with 38 years of history since its establishment in 1984. The school has certainly come a long way and I would like to express my appreciation to the school leaders, staff and students - past and present &ndash; who have contributed to the school&rsquo;s achievements over the years.<br /><br />In Peicai Secondary School (PCSS), we continue to place a premium on the holistic development of our students where both academic excellence and character development are pillars of a holistic education. When students have an interest and find enjoyment in what they do, they will excel and be motivated to pursue their interests well beyond school.<br /><br />The holistic educational experience as well as opportunities we aim to provide in PCSS whilst catering to students&rsquo; strengths, passion and interests, strive to nurture our students to be not just equipped with knowledge and skills but also values and attitudes to navigate the future.&nbsp;<br /><br />Beyond being followers, we strive to nurture our students to become leaders and advocates for worthy causes that would make the school, the nation and the world an even better place thus breathing life into the school&rsquo;s motto -&nbsp;<em>We Make the Difference!<br /></em><br />Professional development and care for our teachers and staff are cornerstones in our goal to develop students as passionate lifelong learners anchored in sound values with Critical Minds and Compassionate Hearts - ready for post-secondary education, for work and for life.<em><br /></em>
<p><p align="justify">The school&rsquo;s value added academic results over the years, strong CCA achievements and high percentage of students being eligible for post-secondary institutions are testimony to the school&rsquo;s commitment to enable each student to reach his or her full potential. The school has several achievements it can be very proud of and credit goes to every staff who has contributed to the school&rsquo;s and the students&rsquo; successes.</p>
<p><p align="justify"><font size="3">With the school&rsquo;s educational philosophy and commitment of teachers and staff as well as the strong support of the School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group, the Alumni and sustained partnerships with stakeholders as well as the community, we are confident that when our students walk out of the PCSS gate as graduates, they are in good stead to take on the future, regardless of the types of opportunities and challenges the future may bring
