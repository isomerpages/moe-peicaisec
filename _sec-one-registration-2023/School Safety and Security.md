<p>Your strong cooperation on safety and security matters is important to our school&rsquo;s commitment to&nbsp;<br />ensure the safety of your child at all times.</p>
<p>Students should only alight/be dropped off at the designated venues in the school.</p>
<p>Like many other driveways, our school's driveway is designed <strong>for passenger pick-up and drop&nbsp;</strong><br /><strong>off only</strong>. Any parking along the driveway not designed for that purpose poses a serious safety&nbsp;<br />concern for students and staff. Hence, parking or waiting is not allowed in the school&rsquo;s driveway.</p>
<p>All visitors to the school including parents/guardians would need to register with our guard post&nbsp;<br />and put on the visitor&rsquo;s tag at all times whilst in school for easy identification.</p>
